IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* add waaaay more sketches with explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* => generally comment for book: be balanced in judgments, shine light to cons AND PROs! e.g. when talking about flow/fun/feel/...
  * at the end, explicitly then state my personal opinion (like kurzgesagt does)
* fun chapter about "CI archetypes" (list pros and cons of each of them)
  * e.g. the ecstatic dance hippie (overly wobbly, smells funny and fancy clothes), the acrobat (fast, technical, dangerous), the dancer (very accentuated, more decoration than substance), the sexy hunter (male or female; little clothes, overly sensual), the rock (insensitive muscle guy lifting everyone, especially small women)
* add more drawings: of vectors (for push/pull/yield... 2 objects)

BIG CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* send out mails/contact to ~20 different CI teachers (all around the world, big ones)
  * ask if they want to ask some (about 5) questions
  * if yes, then send those questions (like tom) to be answered and incorporate the answers
  * they can answer via text or a voice message (i will transcribe it)
  * introduce myself just a bit; my passion for CI, what it did to me; state reason being: "my own personal research"
  * give some praise (ego stroking), a la carnegie's "what's in there for me"
  * questions like:
    1) what is CI? definition (technical, narrative, image)? relate to {dance, sports, ...}? how's different/what's unique about it?
    2) what are (core) principles, common techniques, make it distinct, within (otherwise outside/doing something else), rules/norms
    3) what helps a beginner? common mistakes? safety rules for survival? how to help them in a dance, during it, as an advanced?
    4) what makes a seasoned CI practitioner different/good? qualities, skills, attitude, mindset of an expert of CI? how to spot one (visually)?
    5) last question: if asked to give inspirational speech to a crowd of 10k CI enthusiasts, what'd say?
    x ... TODO: go through tom interview questions
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception
* ad anatomy: muscle fibers (big/medium/small ones, innervening)

CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* tip for practitioners: set reminder every X months to redefine all terms (what is CI for me; qualities; principles; values; ... they regularly change)
* rolls EXERCISE: alone, animal, standing
  * 1) aikido roll; in lanes on the ground
  * 2) on little animal (continuous, like did with yvette): in trios, guardian angel, saying "over" or "under"
  * 3) standing: more difficult&dangerous, only for advanced
* egalitarian: sooo nice + special about CI (and only very few dances out there; not only men/leader and women/follower let go, and not where it being switched, but no roles assigned at all)
  * as a strong (heavy) men, "finally i can feel like a woman, surrender to him, being taken care of, let go"
  * feel free to manipulate/lead, it's enjoyable as a receiver; that clarity feels great
  * the difference in experience/psycho-dynamics between MMF and MFF for example
* achieve symmetry: e.g. with spirals, standing, with foot starting, one side is easier, try to be good with both
  * although arguments for strengthening our strengths, and accept and use the asymetry
* don't try to find too eagerly possibilities to lift! let it happen, and if it doesn't, don't try to use it, because the moment will be immediately be gone (with lots of force, we can, yet not smart to do so; also breaks the flow/continuity)
* feldenkrais; impossible - possible - easy - elegant
* ad physics: a vector is { direction + magnitude } (that magnitude can be force, or anything else)
* ad anatomy: foot/feet/feets, one feet
* head up or down?
  * down, to surrender during floor work; to melt, to "nest"; breathe out while doing so to increase relaxation, yield/ground, soften, flow/adapt
  * up (in direction of trajectory/movement + eyes), direct, focus, engage, lift, fly, light/feather, upwards
* how to dance with a beginner as an advanced?
  * don't tell, but inspire; be a role-model and lead by example
  * convey the basics through the dance (grounding, push them gently, making it clear; sharing weight by leaning gently, gradually; rolling point of contact and slight force into pathway continuation)
  * be patient, go slow; don't get frustrated (you too started once, how would you have been liked to be treated; or when you join another dance class in a different style/school?!)
  * if nothing works: talk, use words; even more needed: take a break, create adhoc-examples; always compliment them of improvements (nicely done, great, good)
  * if yet nothing works; enjoy what is (and focus less on what there isn't)
* how to dance with an advanced as a beginner?
  * TODO
* how to dance the unwanted dance?
  * if your partner goes way too fast, is insensitive, seems to have inappropriate intentions, smells bad, ... TODO
* how to start a dance... yes, definitely eye contact can help sometimes if not clear (some people maybe don't see you, or are too shy to accept the invitation of dancing in negative space); look in eyes, smile, approach, mirror. now totally clear
* ad anatomy: "box" = torso basically; "ships" = shoulder and hips (connected, moveable in all 3 dimensions/planes)
* full body movement: arms + hands, head + eyes; with them engaged, everything gets much easier and moves better (try the opposite, go ahead)
* kinesthetic resonance... TODO: some research about it; sense the other ('s center), peripheric vision; empathy/mirror neurons, ... e.g. contagious yawning; one leans back, the other too (sympathy)
* to mirror the partner (movement, "energy", quality), to do otherwise feels like betrayal; the disconnect
* research mode: feels less enjoyable, more bumpy, experimental (who doesn't fall/fail, does something wrong; no growth, just staying in comfort zone, being cool, showing-off)
  * also less dancing with the partner, less focused on the dance itself, but more on the research topic
  * ego disclaimer useful: tell your partner that it will be worse that what usually capable of
* not only guidelines/recommendations for circle sharing, but also when 1on1 sharing. empathy, listen. talk about yourself, your own experience. never diagnose the other (you are too much of something), even if well intended and you think you are right (and the other one wrong). if wanna correct the other, ask for permission first (healthy feedback culture).
* yi moves -> qi moves -> body; touch it (with intention), there will be attention, there's the you (the self)
  * the touch increases awareness to that specific body part; use it in an exercise: touch your own bodypart (e.g. pelvis) and move along while touching
* sense the center of your partner. why?
  * to connect yours with theirs. to use this connection for lifts. to put your center onto theirs. to only give weight into that center into the ground (otherwise push the partner off-balance). the only way to safely share weight.
* have a moveable pelvis
  * other dance styles do it to look sexy; CI does it to "be" sexy ;) hehe
  * no, seriously: purely functional reason, to lift (especially hip lift), to connect
  * to sense, to connect, to lift
  * no, seriously seriously: CI can be seen as a highly sensual/sexual practice (although often people try to keep that out as much as possible); we humans are sexual beings, and by forcing it into the shadows, it might overpower us unconsciously, and there it may become dangerous; instead, acknowledge it, play with it, yet don't act upon it, stay in control; the plevis must be free, so our sexual energy must be allowed to flow freely; the pelvis, where our sexuality resides (2nd chakra according to tantra; like tantric exercises pelvis release)
  * if sexuality is blocked, CI doesn't work either (yet alone the obvious reason of no physical proximity, touch, intimacy possible; yet no sexuality/sensuality needed)
* discomfort in proxmity; for women: breasts, rolling over the front top; for men: penis, roling over front lower; same-sex partner usually more comfortable with
* rules when sharing in the circle. content. duration. why you share, benefit for others. speak slowly, connect to others, look. dont overshare, frequency.
* always have multiple shirts, sweaty. maybe small tshirt. be washed, smell nice, but no intense scents/perfumes.
* how to give feedback to your partner/s during exercise/dance.
* as a newbie, always good to let your partner know. ps: you are not too much, to the contrary, give more weight.
* choice of partner: male/female balance. old/young. much diversity helps you to grow. and allow yourself your favorites, depending on your capacity to work vs just enjoy. observe your patterns in choices, comfort zone, maybe extend it. also whether you go for it, or let yourself be chosen. do/try the opposite.
* for hiplift, the clock is needed. pelvis flexibility. e.g. not only scooping, but lowering one side as a ramp. first sense, seek, connect centers (dont jump). much can be cheated (chicken leg/wing), base can compensate.
* technique vs strength. see martial arts wisdom...
* !!! ad anatomy: stomach != belly!
* ad anatomy: pelvic/shoulder girdle
* build up: start - middle/core - end
  * start { talk, share, sense, aware, walk, trust }
  * middle { exercise, layered, research }
  * end { free play, wind down, slow, recover, conclusion }
  * ad middle part: single exercise build up:
    * demonstrate: pick/ask for volunteer, me on him (describe/diagnose/comment), then him on me, note where's my emphasize
    * open mic: for questions; confirm with "all clear?" -let's go (music ON)
    * execute and guide: walk around, give feedback, intermediate stop if necessary for group feedback; guide through giving cues, layers/sequences; switch partners
    * share: with partner, then with whole group
* difference: suggesting VS manipulating
  * suggesting: maintain agency of the partner, still can say yes/no
    * can be still a very strong push (useful for extra-ordinary moves/techniques, requiring the base of my partner)
  * manipulating: i force myself on him, grabbing his hand, wrap around/cover fully, no other choice
    * not bad per se, but preferably only with people you know well; some get triggered by it; can be a refreshing spice and open up totally new possibilities; can be very enjoyable too
* "the longer i do it, the slower i go, the fewer trickery i need, as i find {pleasure and joy? fulfillment and satisfaction! meaning and purpose} in the subtleties revealed in depth ('death'?)"
  * the more advanced/experienced i get, the slower i become, more depth in simplicity; no shiny tricks (that's for the intermediate ones); less lifts, more listening
  * when there is trust, we can go high; feeling safe, by going slow, being fully present
  * once we trust, we can go higher and faster
  * PS: acrobats often/usually/always (?) go (very) fast, and lots of tricks very quick, that's potentially very dangerous and they need to learn to slow the fuck down, to surrender in the slowness, to also explore the depth, to go deeper and find sensations in the subtleties, and be less easily attracted/entertained by the superficial trickery
* how to warm up yourself?
  * first of all: do it, don't wait for the teacher-parent to instruct you, to tell you what to do; you are supposed to be a grown up, so start take care of yourself (more important that you do it, instead of what you are doing)
  * easy way: just do what the teacher usually instructs at the beginning of the class -better: understand why he is doing it, and only do it if its applicable
  * lying down, as most dancers would do? maybe for some deep internal investigation, for increased body awareness (mindfulness practice), yes, maybe; for CI? not sure...
  * more inwards: mental awareness, stillness, parasympathicus (psychological body) VS active, physical awareness, sympathicus (physical body)
  * better: use CI to wake up CI relevant body parts! :) we mostly stand, so stand during your warm up; spiral; lifts, rolls, ... do everything you would usually do, just a bit slower/calmer/easier... turned down more. get yourself a partner and just dance, the best!
* the improvised nature of CI:
  * there is no usually not enough time to do something intentionally, e.g. when spotting something (e.g. a possibility for some nice technique), because usually that moment disappears instantly
  * yes, we sometimes can plan it, push it, even force it, a deliberate thing to do; but usually it's just working with what is
* when focusing on a specific research topic, let go of the idea of being good; dare to fuck it up, it's research, not performance;
  * "if you don't fall, you're doing it wrong", because you are playing in the comfort zone, where you can show off, pretend to be good, flawless, perfect; but it won't lead to growth, you will get stuck
  * allow yourself to fail, to fall; let go of your own expectation what you usually can do (yes, you are good enough; so now that you have that validation, can you please move on and research?!), and play/work with what is
  * stop trying to impress/please your partner
* observe your own tendencies: slow/fast, safe/risky, male/female, low/high, ... try to expand and explore both ends of the continuum for each dimension, to have (more) choice and grow
* read people's moving style: says something about/it's based on their past life experiences, their background (dance, acrobatic, ... + how to spot those), personality in general (trust/fear, confidence, self-esteem, easygoing, dare to risk/safe-unsafe risky/courageous, ok to fail/explore/research or play it safe, intimate/distant...), mood today (energy level, emotional state), obviously CI experience/skill
* three stages: beginner's (simple) joy, intermediate's hard work, expert's (sophisticated) joy
  * the reward comes later after the (hard) work
  * fun/pleasure is part of it, it is important to maintain dedication, to not lose motivation, as work alone is not really sustainable (yes, it requires discipline!)
  * but it alone will not get you very far; "up there" is much more fun than "down there"
* to find a (potential) dance partner (or join a duo?): make yourself noticeable by dancing in their negative space, like an accordion going in and out, don't stick too close all the time, give space
* 5 senses plus: balance (vestibular sense), body position (proprioception), movement (kinesthesia); and: pain (nociception), temperature (thermoception); ... many more
* be present with your partner, like in the army, got each other's backs; we re-lie on each other, save him when needed, be a team, together (don't break your partner, you won't get another one). the satisfying feeling when you were there when he needed you, almost fell; the quick response, surprising yourself; the feeling of being needed, being of use.
* have an active research mindset; when exploring a topic/exercise (labbing?), put some active effort in it, think and analyze (constructively; be in your head, as much as possible, but in a good/serving way); BUT: don't let it block you, but guide you. "thinking, a good slave, but a bad master".
  * research mode: staying aware with the exercise AND with the dance/with your partner, can be difficult. OPTIONAL: if you dance in a trio, with the third being the rover (satellite), pay attention to 1) the partner/dance 2) the exercise/research-topic 3) the rover (super difficult shared attention skill)
* EXERCISE: start back2back, going down and up via squad; next: back2back walk in one direction, one partner goes down, other free falls while extending arms; from little animal, one person to the side, other on top, and stand up again (watch out that first upper body upright, and then go upwards), pay attention to not lose the connection (back, lower and upper, and even head)
* list of hints on how to identify a beginner/advanced:
  * clothing: beginners show often lots of skin, dressed sexy; advanced wear their (non-sexy) pyjamas, long sleeves/pants; it's not tango, we don't want to impress, we are who we are, authentical us, not more not less. also sliding on the ground is not possible with direct skin contact, thus skin is covered.
  * touch: beginners use a lot the fingers and hands with a very very soft "butterfly touch" (usually hippie people from the ecstatic dance community); advanced use more the torso and have a weighted touch, when using (fore)arms even those are properly weighted
    * yet, it is not binary/extreme: advanced also can have "cat feet" and have versatile hands. butterfly touch is ok, but not if it is the only tool in your toolbox, and it should be definitely not the default.
  * steps: beginners make lots of little elephants, quick, sharp, loud steps, indicating uncontrolled and potentially dangerous moves; advanced can step like feathers (butterfly steps and elephant arms; not other way round)
* as a good exercise partner (the passive part), you are very actively engaged about what is being done; you observe your partner where he is, what he needs, see his deficiencies and encourage his possibilities (potential), you anticipate a useful scenario where he can grow (proximal zone of development), when there was the slightest improvement compliment saying something simple as "nice"; serve him, be a little teacher
* how to start a dance?
  * same for joining a single or an existing duo...
  * first dance in proximity, dance negative space.
    * usually no eye contact, but sometimes it helps, and then definitely smile, it makes you more likeable/trustworthy.
    * NEVER approach people from the back (they can't see you) and especially NEVER touch right away; no possibility for consent there
  * WAIT - so they are aware of your presence and intention.
  * be attentative to response of you; are they moving towards or away from you?
  * if towards: do some "grasing", backs of arms. usually start back2back.
  * if away: also retreat, respect the people's no, and preferably not take it personally (it might be, but you don't know)
    * recover, shake it off, and try again
    * if you really dare, you can ask the people afterwards about what happened, and how they interpreted it; ask for feedback, what you could have done differently (different approaching, take a shower, change behavior); use it to improve, not to push yourself down.
* how to assess someone's level of skill? give weight or not, pathway continuation or breaking (front of body), jumping, elephants, etc. breath, stiffness/relaxation/muscle tone.
* vocabulary:
  * pouring: slowly/mindfully transferring weight into another physical object (partner/floor). if it would be fast, we would "throw" our weight.
  * yielding: relaxation of muscle tension, usually into gravitation pull (but also other external forces, e.g. push of another person), usually towards the ground (gravitational direction).
  * collapsing: complete, sudden relaxation of muscles, losing structure, without control (no reversability; usually not desired but sometimes can be used as a spice); similar with pouring VS throwing, is yielding VS collapsing
  * center VS core: center=point of gravitational center, below naval (spiritual systems refer also "energetic center"), for women slightly lower (pelvis-shoulder sex difference); core-everything which is connected to the spin, from pubic bone to lower ribs, abs and back, sides/obliques. 
* grounding exercise: with partner, he says ground/tense/yield (don't collapse!) or "claw" (one hand super tensed), and "free"
* grounded: person's center connected to earth's center; all qualities together (yield, push/pull, reach)
* address the situation of dancing with partners of different levels (with perspective of you being in different levels), all the possible combinations, and how to still get the most out of it ("dance with the partner, not with the skill")
* ad anatomy: check that the word "tonality" is explained (=muscle tension) 
* ad round-robin: usually 2,3,4 couples in center, in&out; or different format: half goes in (find partner, assign A/B), other half witnesses with full presence (learning passively)
* stand up, walk, find a place in room. small dance (involuntary micromovements to keep balanced/stand upright), close eyes. breathe. unlock knees. ground... move head left/right, open eyes, checkout others, who is grounded, who not. keep looking outwards into space (dont drawn inwards, like ecstatic dance, stay with the big body). now double the grounding, shift weight (pendulum, not metronom). caress the ground with pointed toes, move hand, arms, ribcage. octopus quality. breathe. smile and look at others. start walking. in negative space move. also look behind yourself with your back.
* 3x3x3: orbit around another center. no eye contact, not front2front. maybe trio. no contact first. slow down much. find backs, share weight, breathe out... 5,4,3,2,1... bye. shake it off. walk around. after 3rd: find a comfortable position for both. let them talk a bit, drink. back to big circle. sharing. next!
* grounding is NOT heavy! do the shiatsu "find your center". take from taiji. do the competition pushing each other over, circle, enter whoever wants.
* consent exercises: coming closer, waving 12345, different ways approaching. push, partner says "stop", we say thank you.
* exercise: how to enter and leave a duette. a few rovers. game: in trio, try that other 2 cant dance with each other.
* bring more personal stories, make it relatable. what happened in toms classes, etc.
* GROUNDING is not contracting muscles; making you stiff; it may feel like stable/robust (grounded), but it's not. easily checked by testing you, by a partner; are you still agile, flexible, can you move? can you breathe freely? groundedness means still being relaxed and soft, surrender, let gravity pull heavy on your body into the floor; it's relaxation (opening), not contraction (closing). yet, easily mixed up, as the sensation might be similar at first. also: with contraction there is some degree of success possible (when the partner pouring his weight onto you), but it has its limitations, it is effortfull, and takes away flexibility/adaptibility, thus ultimate is dangerous.

!!! workshop notes flying incorporate
! gravity - steve paxton book
* write more about anatomy, vestibular/inner ear
* write more about gravity in physics (counter intuitive reality; unknown quantum realm, gravitrons?)
* combine this: how movement and gravitational pull relates
* nancy stark, underscore
* add more exercises
* term "score" (exercise? theme?); underscore
* dresscode: no jewelery (rings, ear rings, bracelets) as dangerous, no belt, not too much naked skin (sweaty, slippery, and for some people too sexy/uncomfortable; some decency, CI is a non-sensual practice)
* no "parking" or socializing on the dancefloor, move to the sides
* guide how to dis/engage a dance: mirror the person, bit eye contact, finger/hand touch, back2back; disengage namaste/hug, use water drinking as excuse, say thank you and roll away
* attitudes: playful, curiosity, care, responsibility
* what makes CI different: all levels (not just standing), it's 3D; and also 1/2/many people dancing with each other; it's goal is not to be aesthetical pleasing (as with most dance forms)
* basic body skills: relaxation (not stiff), listening (following), gentle/softness, flexibility/mobility, in joints, balance, general body awareness.
* under/overdancer is superset of base/flyer
* movement quality: expand/fold alias flexion/extension (going down fold, going up expand).
* saying stop/no, consent, safety during dance. tom's workshop. orange/red boundary. not endura. last ressort: say out loud.
* uncommon spices: manipulation of the head, counter-balancing
* the advantage of going slow. more input/details, safer. if can do slow, also fast (but not other way round).
* nesting a la raul. fill the space. cuddle in; esp. floorwork.
* also raul: giving air, finding bridges. basically give away weight while partner aligns.
* move eyes, moves head, moves spine, moves everything else.
* breathe!!!! relax, be moveable again. also to co-regulate partner/others in the room.
* dresscode: kneepads. which ones, what to watch out for. also for pants, not to loose because getting stuck.
* ad jam, bring multiple shirts, because sweaty. in general: hygiene (body, mouth, clothes, nails), as close up.
* processus spinosus - part of spine bulging out (protrusion), when you do a roll wrong
* ad physics: pressure measured in newton (i think 10N = 1kg?)
* idea: small chapter about basic injuries (after quick intro into tissue and stuff), like dislocation, hematome; what it is, how it might happen, and how to treat it (movement/stillness, taping, warmth/cold, massage, ...)
* ad movement: kinesphere; picture is similar to Da Vinci's "vitruvian man" but more complex
* harvest video, and keep track that done so in list: https://youtu.be/9FeSDsmIeHA?si=h3kcbSBgbbz2mhbM

LATER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@tom: can you give me all your CI videos? :)
* still not sure: gravitons? which particle makes gravity? a field? physics not yet sure...
* prolog: "everything that can be learned (by yourself) is not worth being taught (by someone else)" ("alles was gelernt werden kann, ist nicht wert gelehrt zu werden")
  * intention of this book is to only teach what needs to be taught, everything else you can teach yourself ;)
* add way more exercises to be done by the reader
* watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA
* read https://compendium.copim.ac.uk/practices/60
* latex templates: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/book
* center of gravity/grounding (heavy, low, abdomen; being the base/underdancer) VS center of levitian/floating (light, high, chest; being the flyer/overdancer)
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* beginners want to just enjoy, not willing to invest the necessary work ("too technical" they say; destroyed all their joy and fun). these people won't get far anywhere, not in CI nor in life in general. yes, fun/pleasure is important, but that itself won't get us anywhere. it's like learning to drive a car: first it might be fun to play as children in the car of our parents while it's turned off, but we don't actually getting somewhere. later we take driving lessons, very technical, hyper focused, tensed... not fun. once we mastered the steering wheel, padels, mirrors and rules in traffic, we can start to play and enjoy again, doing risky tricks/moves, have a talk and listen to music. BUT: there is no shortcut, we need to go through the intermediate state of hard work to finally reach the other end where there is joy again, built upon a firm foundation of repetition, dedication and commitment. 
* terms/glossary: under-dancer, over-dancer
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* small dance (usually still, just listening inside); making it "small dance plus" by using that information as raw material/source and amplify it making it bigger/visible movements
* rework glossary: scan whole document for terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* own section trios+
* contact, touch, negative space
* ad movement qualities: ad speed, also pausing
* new section: "oldschool CI" - impact, jump, acrobatic
* start to draw drawings
