TO*DO list
====================================================================================================

* ... CURRENT: run through auto-correct language tool
* proofreaders: ursula (bin/make_word.sh) julienne (send PDF? latex github sources)
* start to sketch first few drawings

* give it a proper (sub?!) title, e.g.:
  * "Small Steps into the Wonderful World of Contact Improvisation"
  * "Small Dance into the Art Form of Contact Improvisation"
* 2ndary:
  * all "fancy words" as glossary items?
  * add some more content to chapter "World"

PROOF READ
------------------------------------------------------------------------
syntax:
* spelling/grammar mistakes (capitalization).
* proper usage of interpunctation; paranthesis "()", comma ",", dash "-", semicolon ";"

semantic:
* difficult domain-specific words in glossary?
* same word repeating?
* too simply adjectives (e.g. nice, good)? -> replace by more diverse words
* too long sentences can be shortened

complex:
* can additional images/figures help better understanding?
* does order of chapter make sense?
* does content belong to other chapter?


CONTENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* add more exercises
* term "score" (exercise? theme?); underscore
* dresscode: no jewelery (rings, ear rings, bracelets) as dangerous, no belt, not too much naked skin (sweaty, slippery, and for some people too sexy/uncomfortable; some decency, CI is a non-sensual practice)
* no "parking" or socializing on the dancefloor, move to the sides
* guide how to dis/engage a dance: mirror the person, bit eye contact, finger/hand touch, back2back; disengage namaste/hug, use water drinking as excuse, say thank you and roll away
* attitudes: playful, curiosity, care, responsibility
* what makes CI different: all levels (not just standing), it's 3D; and also 1/2/many people dancing with each other; it's goal is not to be aesthetical pleasing (as with most dance forms)
* basic body skills: relaxation (not stiff), listening (following), gentle/softness, flexibility/mobility, in joints, balance, general body awareness.
* under/overdancer is superset of base/flyer
* movement quality: expand/fold alias flexion/extension (going down fold, going up expand).
* saying stop/no, consent, safety during dance. tom's workshop. orange/red boundary. not endura. last ressort: say out loud.
* uncommon spices: manipulation of the head, counter-balancing
* the advantage of going slow. more input/details, safer. if can do slow, also fast (but not other way round).
* nesting a la raul. fill the space. cuddle in; esp. floorwork.
* also raul: giving air, finding bridges. basically give away weight while partner aligns.
* move eyes, moves head, moves spine, moves everything else.
* breathe!!!! relax, be moveable again. also to co-regulate partner/others in the room.
* dresscode: kneepads. which ones, what to watch out for. also for pants, not to loose because getting stuck.
* ad jam, bring multiple shirts, because sweaty. in general: hygiene (body, mouth, clothes, nails), as close up.


LATER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@tom: can you give me all your CI videos? :)
* add way more exercises to be done by the reader
* watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA
* read https://compendium.copim.ac.uk/practices/60
* latex templates: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/book
* center of gravity/grounding (heavy, low, abdomen; being the base/underdancer) VS center of levitian/floating (light, high, chest; being the flyer/overdancer)
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* beginners want to just enjoy, not willing to invest the necessary work ("too technical" they say; destroyed all their joy and fun). these people won't get far anywhere, not in CI nor in life in general. yes, fun/pleasure is important, but that itself won't get us anywhere. it's like learning to drive a car: first it might be fun to play as children in the car of our parents while it's turned off, but we don't actually getting somewhere. later we take driving lessons, very technical, hyper focused, tensed... not fun. once we mastered the steering wheel, padels, mirrors and rules in traffic, we can start to play and enjoy again, doing risky tricks/moves, have a talk and listen to music. BUT: there is no shortcut, we need to go through the intermediate state of hard work to finally reach the other end where there is joy again, built upon a firm foundation of repetition, dedication and commitment. 
* terms/glossary: under-dancer, over-dancer
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* small dance (usually still, just listening inside); making it "small dance plus" by using that information as raw material/source and amplify it making it bigger/visible movements
* rework glossary: scan whole document for terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* own section trios+
* contact, touch, negative space
* ad movement qualities: ad speed, also pausing
* new section: "oldschool CI" - impact, jump, acrobatic
* start to draw drawings

PUBLISHING

what to do first?

* let content be checked by CI practitioners
* let grammar/spelling/wording checked by professionals (julien knows)
* get licensing right
* amazon (or other) for getting hardcopies
* announce/marketing/PR
