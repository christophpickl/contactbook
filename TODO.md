LATER
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* center of gravity/grounding (heavy, low, abdomen; being the base/underdancer) VS center of levitian/floating (light, high, chest; being the flyer/overdancer)
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* beginners want to just enjoy, not willing to invest the necessary work ("too technical" they say; destroyed all their joy and fun). these people won't get far anywhere, not in CI nor in life in general. yes, fun/pleasure is important, but that itself won't get us anywhere. it's like learning to drive a car: first it might be fun to play as children in the car of our parents while it's turned off, but we don't actually getting somewhere. later we take driving lessons, very technical, hyper focused, tensed... not fun. once we mastered the steering wheel, padels, mirrors and rules in traffic, we can start to play and enjoy again, doing risky tricks/moves, have a talk and listen to music. BUT: there is no shortcut, we need to go through the intermediate state of hard work to finally reach the other end where there is joy again, built upon a firm foundation of repetition, dedication and commitment. 
* terms/glossary: under-dancer, over-dancer
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* small dance (usually still, just listening inside); making it "small dance plus" by using that information as raw material/source and amplify it making it bigger/visible movements
* rework glossary: scan whole document for terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
* own section trios+
* contact, touch, negative space
* ad movement qualities: ad speed, also pausing
* new section: "oldschool CI" - impact, jump, acrobatic
* start to draw drawings
