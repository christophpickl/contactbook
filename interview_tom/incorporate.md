## 3.3 for whom is CI, for whom isn't it a good idea to join? (physical requirements? touch-averse people?)

* in general: everybody is welcome (not necessarily every behavior though)
* not about age (even 70+ is possible), not about body ability
    * yet some techniques might not be possible, or would need some adaption
    * even a person with 72 years old, able shoulder lifts, doing it for many years; some of the crazy things might be though for "the next life" ;)
* but sharing weight, being in contact with another body, exploring what's happening (where's weight/unconscious reaction to balance/mind) = anybody can do
* even with partially disabled body (some physical disability)
    * even people in wheelchair can do it, together with physically fit people
    * or blind people: super in tune with weight and different other aspects
    * very different and interesting kind of exploration
        * renegotiate/re-explore what kind of communication we can play
* even with a huge weight difference, we just need to be more careful
    * which kinds of lifts, who is carrying whom how
    * no shoulder lifts, no rolling; negotiate what's possible
    * respect (check slowly, step-by-step) the abilities of the dance (both bodies), then it becomes safer (not necessarily safe!)
* otherwise, do the crazy things with a lot of care and guardian angels (people who spot you)
* theoretically (in an ideal world), everyone is welcome, yet: not advised for people with severe touch aversion (e.g. due to trauma in that field) to jump into CI (as a solution/practice)
    * better tippie toe in different kind of forms, then see if continue to CI
    * mental challenges sometimes make people join only one (or even a half) class (or the teacher might have doubts)
* people who take too many risks (the "dangerous ones"); throwing themselves on unknown partners
    * they won't be denied access to classes/jams, but dancers will most likely keep their distance as it won't feel safe

## 3.5 how can i differentiate between a good and a bad teacher? (safe / unsafe community / jam)

* three realms to consider:
    * 1. physical aspect:
        * they know what they are teaching
        * also being honest about it limitations in that knowledge (humbleness)
    * 2. psychological aspect:
        * ability to hold space (for processes that might happen)
        * safety is about intention: not wanting to inflate ego (making bigger)
        * not wanting to gain anything outside the class (besides monetary compensation in formally agreed transaction)
        * no claim to be a master/guru; teacher is "one of us" (going for a drink with people, taking teacher hat off)
    * 3. spiritual aspect
        * absence of competition: wanting the student to be as good / better as themselves
        * pure intention to teach; sharing knowledge (also two-way though)

## 3.6 what are the unwritten, implicit socially accepted behaviors in CI? (talking? eye gazing?)

* making the implicit rules explicit
* start slowly
* don't eye gaze for too long (they will tell you that this is not the way)
* in a class with a teacher there is more guidance
* in a jam it might be more difficult
    * take first 5-10 minutes to sit and watch / observe the "communal implicit norms"
    * every jam is different (yet there is a common set of baseline rules)
    * talk less (not too loud, not too long, not on the dancefloor)
    * don't "park" on the dancefloor (parking = lying on the floor, eyes closed, being unaware of surroundings)
* no sexuality: the teacher will take that off very fast (or the jam facilitator, if present)
* "appropriate" clothes (see further up); people won't dance with you because of that (not because of you as a person)
* personal hygiene: normal and above; shower; good smells (not too strong perfume)
* cuddles (cuddle puddles) will happen, and are being tolerated, but are not intentional!
    * the group will "notice" that behavior if that's your intention; again: people might not want to dance with you anymore
    * none prohibit it, some jams tolerate it, few invite it, but mostly it just doesn't happen
    * often there is a partner bodywork at the end (a typical thing dancers would do); a more technical/medical/sports massage than a personal/emotional/intimate touch session

# 4. SOCIAL

## 4.1 what does the community look like? how is it organized?

* the term "community" is about people living in the same place
    * sharing more knowledge about each other rather than a practice
    * helping each other in times of need
    * trend in our society: companies saying "come join the family"
* community here: group of people sharing the same passion for this practice
    * getting curious about the other person, from a very basic physical connection
    * their life, experiences, ideas... afterward often also sharing food; from their, friendship can happen
    * sometimes also just a great dance partner, but personally nothing in common with (not wanting to be friends)
    * less care for "only dance partners", less than for example neighbour
    * this is a bit off in the contact "community"
    * not really a: if they don't come (to classes/jams), they're not friends, we still reach out
    * in small classes, there is usually a sense of community; asking where one is; helping each other out (healthy issues, financially); support if needed
* there are silos, according to the attitude of the teacher/jam, people will converge into specific places (norms will differ based on that)
* collaboration over competition: CI people/teachers believe in what they do, the goodness that it gives to the world
    * they want to expand the pool to reach more people
    * maybe more competition if only source of income and rely on it (scarce modality); livelihood/hobby/passion
    * some teachers will invite guest teachers (if not here), or send people to another teacher (different city, or teacher being more technical)
    * not much "fighting" among CI practitioners happening, but also collaboration are not so often happening (it's a very individual practice)
* there are festivals, where (abroad) teachers are being invited
* usually city-based teacher (2-3 classes a week); sometimes there are "traveller teachers"
* usually when invited, then not by other teachers, but by schools/institutions/organizers
    * there is a win-win-win in having different student-teacher relationships in one's own workshop

## 4.2 can you give a description of a "stereotypical" CI person?

* wearing dance clothes; nothing casual/street clothes but also not too fancy
* age is a big range, yet for technical part it's usually around 25-45
* social economical a little bit on the high end (richer people; yet, teachers might be willing to give a discount to people who cant easily afford paying for the classes/workshops)
* strictly religious seem not to be attracted by it; most likely because of the touch, physical proximity
* there is no clear stereotypical physical appearance for "CI people" (thinking of images we might have with yoga, hiphop, tantra, ...)
    * yet, CI people are very quickly spotted on the dancefloor, how they move, how they engage, behavior with weight
    * there is a mutual, unconscious ability to spot each other on the dancefloor which makes them find each other -like magic :)
* CI people have no need to attach themselves to a subculture and shape their personality around it; no need for "another stamp"
    * CI is about the physicality, and less a "spiritual practice for personal growth" (or community, as stated above)
    * the way we move might although influence our personality (as in increased sensuality when moving tango); but that's no such thing in CI
    * it's very egalitarian (no roles) and plain physical form; more technical/raw, no (moral) values conveyed; whereas the egalitarian approach might be a value it contains ;)
        * independent of sex/gender/age/body; no leading/following based on sex/gender, just play
* CI don't convince others of they greatness of CI, although everyone is invited and welcome to join; it's fun

## 4.3 how does such a very intimate touch based movement form in today's (distant) society?

* in very strictly gender-roled societies (e.g. not same-sex touch permitted), CI would have big problems to become popular
* western world is seen as non-touch societies, there are bubbles where it is allowed/encouraged
    * e.g. couple dancing (although not entire body, only holding/embracing arms and back)
    * because of the lack of touch/connection, us as social mammals, these bubbles might get more and more attraction
    * especially people who don't have people close to them (relatives, loved ones, partner; during COVID), feel that human need for touch
        * BUT: this is not the aim of CI, it's a very nice additional side effect
        * people who only come for that side effect, won't stay long in CI; there are other places where one gets touch for that purpose
* using CI to "heal the world" seems a bit... utopian (naive?), well-fitted for younger people, with lots of enthusiasm being eager
    * that eagerness comes because CI can change one's life
    * "if everyone would do CI there would be no wars anymore, and it would be the end of capitalism" - the young
    * "CI is a very, very rich, beneficial and amazing dance form, and it might not change the world, but it did change me" - the old
    * the more we spread it, the better ;)

## 4.4 aren't there lots of horny people rubbing their body's on each other?

* in classes, it happens very very very rarely (teacher taking care of a safe space for participants)
    * teachers will stop any form of sexual intended / predatory behavior right away, declaring it as a clear  "no-go"
    * that's also why people should go first to a class to learn the norms and values, instead dropping in a jam right away
* at jams without a supervisor no one knows (maybe relatively more often?)
    * often there is an organizer though, which can repeat clear rules and guidelines in an opening circle
    * minimizing the probability of such non-welcome behavior
* comparing to ecstatic or tantric dance with CI: in CI are waaaay less "horny people" showing up ;)

# 5. TECHNICAL

## 5.1 what makes a good CI practitioner good? (quality, attitude, skills)

* right intention for dance
* regarding attitude/mindset: curiosity (the antidote to being judgmental)
* a very important tool: listening to small sensations in the body (change of movement/weight)
    * increased awareness of incoming information (inside and outside the body; peripheral nervous system; "skinesphere")
    * being able to detect what's going on
    * being "well-informed" leads to becoming a much better dancer
* respect what your body is able to do (in regard to level, age, constitution)
* for many, dancing with totally beginners and total advanced is most enjoyable: reminder/showing different aspects of the dance
    * both are usually very happy to dance with each other
* intermediate are usually not happy to dance with beginners (only own level or higher)
    * they are usually the "dangerous" ones, as they know the pathways/tricks (form/looks), but they don't know what they don't know
    * lacking listening ability, if something happens not predicted in their pathways (quick changes and how to handle that)
    * often go faster than their level of attention; very often go faster than their beginner-partner's level of attention
* an advanced practitioner is really happy exploring the smallest thing, being able to keep a beginner's mind open
    * they know what they know, and they know what they don't know
* more general (for any form): kind (smiling, gentle, soft), humble (not showing off how many years is doing this-or-that, not arrogantly teaching beginners), patient (let the beginners do their own mistakes/gain own experience)
    * everybody teaches, there is no certificate; if you have a lot of knowledge, you will share that by your dancing
* years itself are not necessarily a guarantee for expertise/mastery!
    * some people get stuck at a certain level even after many years
        * even if technical level is advanced... the moment where one stops posing questions is where one stops developing
        * keeping a beginner's mind: keep on doing the very same thing (lifts and spirals), yet stay with curiosity and explore deeper (the small things/changes, where to focus now/put attention/intention)
    * even lots of experience itself doesn't mean your level of technical practise is going forward

## 5.2 what are the core movement principles/patterns?

* the techniques are based on the principles; the principles are core
    * short: 1) sharing weight 2) rolling point of contact
* recognizing weight; sharing weight
* recognizing/listen to your small dance (in each position)
    * classically done only standing (that's how it started; strongest way to balance due to small surface)
    * but: core is the perception of reaction to the process of balance
    * thus: in any position (except when completely lying down) there is a small dance, because the body is trying to balance itself
    * figuring out one's own and partner's center (as lifts are happening from there)
* rolling point of contact (pathway)
* core movement pattern: spirals
* and lots of techniques around lifts
* later, once principles are embodied, they show up ("surprise you when they happen and change your pathways")
    * also in high velocity, risk engaged dance; with a super, super high level of alertness/attention; jumping on each other yet landing safely back on the ground

## 5.3 are there "clearly defined, labeled techniques" or is CI a more principle based system?

* yes, there are also techniques, but the principles are at the core of CI
* the difference between grammar (=principles; universal, abstract) and vocabulary (=techniques; specific, concrete)
    * even in the US we will use the same grammar, but the words (vocabulary) and especially style will be slightly different; small hiccups might happen
    * yet: we will be able to understand each other as the principles stay the same
* often necessary to stay a few hours with a new teacher to embody their body language, from which the vocabulary comes
* vocabulary like lifts is a rather regional expression of the application of the commonly shared principles

## 5.4 what are some of your favorite mottos?

* "we try not to fall in love with our partner, we fall in love with the dance"
    * because it's not a personal dance, it's a physicality; the experience is because of the practice, not because of your partner(s) necessarily; don't attach that to a specific person
    * even when had an amazing dance with someone, once the dance is over, i'm going to say "thank you, and bye bye"
        * possible to talk to that person later on, but not lingering and dance the entire class/jam with that person
* "dance at the edge of your level of attention, and don't cross the level of your partner's attention"
    * try to expand what you are able (movement/attention; speed, techniques, pathways)
    * listen to what your partner is able as well
* also: tension masks sensation (by steve paxton)

## 5.5 most used classes' animals (octopus, koala, panda, elephant) and sounds (oomph, bots, wee, mooshimooshi)

* there are no universal names for techniques/qualities, but different teachers try to invent, share, and give credits to their inventions.
    * an oral tradition has established of passing information
    * animals are beneficial as they have a very visual characteristic; visceral experience; qualities that animal embodies
    * useful to convey an idea (otherwise many, many sentences would be needed; the whole purpose of introducing and using jargon, not to smartass, but for increased information exchange/more dense)
* animals as an attempt to introduce technical vocabulary for positions and techniques:
    * chicken wing: using a "semi lock" with the arm pit on the partner while being lifted (or similar); often necessary if centers are not stacked and being unbalanced
    * chicken leg: the same as the chicken wing but with the hip flexed
    * koala: a hug basically; hugging a partner's torso while hanging on him sideways (either around shoulders or pelvis)
    * octopus: quality movement where all joints/whole body is involved in a relaxed/soft manner
    * (little) elephant: when someone falls, the sound when landing hard with the feet (either walking or landing from lift); indication of no control/no relaxation
    * panda: ???
    * crab: ???
    * banana: extending the whole body as a bow; can be practiced on the ground, but applied often while being on the back of a partner
* "sounds terms" as an attempt to introduce technical vocabulary for qualities (fuzzy principles) and more abstract phenomena:
    * oomph: giving/sharing weight, not only a slight touch, but really firm, high pressure contact
    * bots: (=to clash/collide) when the instruction conflict with your inner wisdom (e.g. jumping, but you feel lots of fear/resistance to do so); when the teacher's words conflict (bots) with what you want/don't want, the inner teacher always wins (dutch word; bot=bone; like two fists smashed on each other)
    * wee: sung sound; allowing the body to relax the atmosphere/to release tension/to calm down; counteracting fear/panic (e.g. while being lifted); everybody smiles
    * hoopity poop: fancy technical, acrobatic stuff; looking impressive yet not necessarily shows much skill (jumping on each other)
    * mooshy mooshy (mushy? mooshi?): non-clear/sensual intention, very slow, cuddle puddles
    * lala land: a cute way to refer to the esoteric, superstitious world; things which are better suited in the metaphysical world (spirituality, religion)

# 6. OUTRO

## 6.1 in which direction will CI develop in the next 10 years?

* hopefully it will keep a very strong trunk
    * people keep on researching the practice, still knowing where it comes from, its roots
    * welcoming the branches, e.g.: CI combined with other practices like "contact tango", "contact beyond contact"... or CI with using substances for "other states of awareness"
    * as the tree is branching, that the main trunk will stay the main trunk
    * that there is no need for the distinction between "i am a CI purist" and simply: "i'm doing CI"
    * the last 50 years the trunk stayed stable, yet the last 20 years lots of branches emerged; branches which merge different forms together
    * also good, those branches/merges, that people are aware that that's not CI the way it is actually practiced
    * what's needed: good teachers/jams/spaces where the ideas/principles are held from CI; knowing the physical aspect but also the history

## 6.2 any good books (websites, movies) about CI you recommend watching?

* contact quarterly website ("official CI channel")
* material for the spine, by steve paxton (after he did some CI), a new line of research
* underscore, by nancy stalks smith
* videos (good practice to watch them once in a while):
    * magnesium, fall after newton, ... (everything between 1972 and 1980)
* books (about 10 good ones which are specifically for CI):
    * sharing the dance, by cynthia novack
    * dancing deeper still, by martin keogh

## 6.3 something to tell people who never tried but are curious about it now?

* check some youtube videos
    * don't be intimidated from what you are seeing (usually only high level people publish videos; that's not what you are going to encounter at first)
* join a recommended teacher
* go first to some classes (not immediately to jams; only after 10-20 classes, to have the basic principles embodied)
* don't give up if your very first experience seems bad; maybe you want to try another class/teacher
* CI is not only physical; ask yourself: why and what am i doing; this is very beneficial and inspiring
