WORKSHOP
from ground to sky
tom goldhand, 3-day intense, 18.-20. october 2024

grounding, relaxing (exhale, opening, release) while maintaining structure (otherwise collapse), increasing contact surface, increasing felt pressure on the ground.
like sucking into the soil, growing roots, melting, merging with it, becoming one, like a tree.





QUALITIES
========================
* (movement/body) qualities: push, pull, ground, yield, reach, extend,... float, tense, tension, lethargic, ...
* different types of definitions: technical / narrative / imaginary
* similar to taijiquan, push while bending (going up while going down; like higher sophisticated weight-lifting); let gravity pull, while "push against" (without actually pushing, or at least muscle activation below a threshold where movement actually happens; like when limb is on the ground, trying to lift it with too little effort to be able to lift it, that amount!); use only intention
* the way we define those qualities, is the way we dance; so listen carefully to each other's definitions (no need to agree, just acknowledge)
* talking about movement qualities; just "imaginary" words... in the end, just muscle contraction exist
  * imaginary language can help to convey meaning, as reality (literal talk) would be too complex
  * also the way we use our body is in an abstract command language; reach for a cup, instead of contracting flexor carpor radialis (we don't know which muscle that is, let alone the medical term of it); translation unit in the brain, like asterix (plan) and oberix (execution); we are operating on a higher level of abstraction
* when doing solo exercises (qualities), allow yourself to enjoy the movement; pleasure (like in gaga)
* difference: ground (down relax) / push (closed, contract) / lean (off-balance)
* yield and push are opposites
* small dance is: active yield and push; also reach + pull
  * grounding has all 4 qualities; embody them, experience them
* how's reaching possible if underlying there's only contraction happening?
  * physical level: it's like "no hot/cold because only temperature", or steering will "push one, thus pull other", it's transactional like buy/sell
  * pulling on joint from one side, push on the other; if bone would be straight then yes, impossible; but because joint + muscles on sides attached...
* shared center of mass: when 2 bodies share weight (lean on each other, push, or some contact) they become kind-of 1 body and have 1 center (of gravity/mass)
  * like visualizing a red dot (or a ball, when more surface contact, becomes bigger and more fuzzy)
  * giving weight, when it moves too sharply => danger!

GROUNDING
------------------------
* "smart feet": like hands, perceptive + moveable
* with lots of grounding + shared weight => support; much more is possible with it
  * grounding is required for sharing weight (a prerequisite)
  * grounding, required for sharing weight, required for pouring weight, required for an elegant lift
  * thus, no need to jump/go on toes, for an elegant=passive lift which "just happens"
* why is there no grounding? lots of little elephants... tension, stiff, nervous, insecure... how to improve it? how to support your (beginner) partner (non-verbally) to find grounding? ... slow down, exhale audibly, be grounded yourself (inspire)
* we usually practice grounding while standing, yet CI has different levels: little animal and also bit higher up, and down to floorwork; totally under-represented!
* grounding is also about posture; aligned structure, constructing a frame; bone stacking in direction of incoming force
* how does grounding relate to floating/levithian? in taijiquan: upper body/arms are floating lightly (yin, towards the heaven), the lower part, legs, pelvis is grounded (yang, towards earth), the center (men) connects both worlds, both united in one.
* it is about engaging in parasympathetic nervous system
* it is intention for lowering the center of mass; yet not necessarily literally in space going down (more about relaxing, lowering muscle tonus, "opening the joints")
* while dancing, help the partner to be more grounded by pushing down, especially on hips
* the grounding overly charicaturized/sketched is knees bending, downwards; BUT: we can also go up, on toes, although much more difficult, yet possible
* most people confuse tension with grounding/extending

DEFINITION "more is more":
also "rooting" or "earthing", is an elementary/basic, almost therapeutic technique/act/method/process to reach a calm/present/attentative/aware state on the mental, and a firm/stable/strong/robust yet soft on the physical level. through relaxation (minimum force/effort/tension, letting go)/opening/centering/sinking/lowering, a foundation is laid, providing an intra-/inter-connected structure/base/aligned support (usually feet/soles, but any point of contact with the ground), allowing reliability/taking/carrying incoming force and dealing with impact in a more unaffected/indifferent way.
it can be achieved by lying down (ground/earth, water, weighted blankets; skin contact, deep&slow massage), barefoot walking, breathing exercises (deep exhale focus), mindfulness practice, etc.
the opposite of floating -center of gravitiy vs center of levithian.

DEFINITION physical/technical:
relaxation of unnecessary muscle tension while maintaining an aligned, supportive structure to carry weight / withstand incoming force.

DEFINITION physical/imaginary:
feel like gravity is pulling on every single cell of your body downwards.
while it pulls you down, you push yourself up, like a spring wanting to go up while you push it down, or a ball you push under the water.

DEFINITION physical/narrative:
like a big ball hanging from your pelvis (between genitals and anus), the one's from the big clocks, pulling on your spine, while your legs are like firm hard-rubber.
while you move, that ball is almost not moving, but keeps being pulled down towards the center of the earth, your body maintaining it's firm-springy-quality, like bamboo.

DEFINITION psychological:
although being exposed to difficulties, staying calm and centered, not losing one's grip; almost like maintaining one's smile while being slapped in the face.
not really indifferent, still aware and connected what's happening, but "less fucks given", and accepting with courage what is, taking it with heroic stability.

DEFINITION universal:
maintaining stability and one's center, not giving in to external forces, yet without stiffness but with controlled relaxation (relax, not collapse). 

PUSH
------------------------
* the ground can't be pushed, it only maintains its structure, same as a trampoline (kinetic force in, and bounce back), or spring quality in martial arts
* 2 (or more) bodies involved (e.g.: me + wall)
* anatomically/physically => muscles: extension, sarcomere bigger distance
* pushing without grounding possible, but structure will pay the price
* a rubber band charged with an object (bullet), is it pushing?!
* when 2 dancers use push, often it results into a small fight (instead of "small dance"), playing against instead with each other (especially 2 men)
* push is underused as easily considered "rude"; taking away most precious agency
  * CI is egaliterian, different than other dance styles with leader/follower roles, where manipulation is rather the norm, nothing else.
* be more nuanced with push: soft push (comfortable), sharp/hard push (annoying)

DEFINITION "more is more":
using a deliberate/intentional, expanding (external/outward, away from center, forward-directed) force to manipulate an object's position, e.g. resulting in destabilization (attack/dislike) or support (defend/protect).
because it's an active wanting, it's exhaustive and requires a counter-push to maintain equilibrium.

DEFINITION physical/technical:
exerting controlled, deliberate force to an object to move it away from one's center.

DEFINITION physical/imaginary:
like there is a balloon inflating inside of your body, and it has only one possible gate to expand, which is the bodypart you want to push.

DEFINITION physical/narrative:
like when two deer fight with each other, bumping their heads, pushing into the ground, to fight about their position in the hierarchy.

DEFINITION psychological:
increase personal/emotional distance, to challenge someone (friendly invitation, support; emphasize urgency if being ignored) or create own safety.
a "pushy person" is an annoying person who wants too much.

DEFINITION universal:
increasing the distance between two objects by making an effort.
the opposite of pull.

PULL
------------------------
* if pull someone, you have to either push the floor, OR counter-pull
* opposite of push, active, otherwise same (2 bodies) but inwards (2 bodies towards each other), contraction
* requires hook/grab/attachment, it requires contact
* edge case, when pulling sideways: distance of bodies don't change, so point of reference moves from puller to pullee (towards center = push sideways, away from his center = pull sideways)
* gravity ALWAYS pulling (exerting force)
* bring mutual mass closer, exert force on each other
* we don't grab, so alternatives (used for pulling): lock, hook

DEFINITION physical/technical:
exerting controlled, deliberate force to an object to move it closer towards one's center.

DEFINITION physical/imaginary:
like you are so terribly hungry, a little blackhole has formed in your lower belly, sucking everything in like the strongest dyson vacuum device you've ever seen.

DEFINITION physical/narrative:
the same as the moon can't escape the earth, and the earth can't escape the sun, so we can't escape the floor, and our partner us if we pull them.
we become the sun, keeping the trabant firmly in our grip, like a spider keeps its prey in its web, no chance for it to escape.

DEFINITION psychological:
feeling an irresistible attraction towards someone, like a gravitational force or a magnet.
feelings of strong, unexplainable sympathy. unconscious desire to be close to that person.

DEFINITION universal:
decreasing the distance between two objects by making an effort.
the opposite of push.

YIELD
------------------------
DEFINITION FINAL:
a neutral and voluntary resignation; a sign of healthy surrender, complying with what is, accepting it, yet not collapsing, maintaining structural integrity. by relaxation, allowing flexibility to adapt to incoming forces of push&pull. a soft confrontation into. to produce by obedience.

DEFINITION:
* to yield is a neutral and voluntary way of resignation, a sign of (healthy) surrender/submission, complying/accomodating of what is, acknowledge/accepting the current state; yet not collapsing, maintaining structure where necessary.
* it is done by softening/relaxing, allowing for flexibility in order to adapt/complement to incoming forces; whether push/pull (gravity/partner/argument).
* A "soft confrontation into".
* Or simply: to produce a result by obeying.

SHORTS:
* to accept/embrace a state/force by relaxing into it
* a neutral form of voluntary resignation to what is
* allowing thing to happen as they are

KEYWORDS/BRAINSTORMING:
give up/in, go with, surrender, comply, accommodating, submit, neutral/voluntary resignation
follow/accompany, acknowledge/allowing/accept/embrace (state/force), give way to pressure (argument/influence)
soft(en), relax (where necessary! more stable than collapse)
complement/wrap around, adapt, flexible, bendable
"soft confrontation into"
downwards (with gravity)
OR: produce a result, giving (a)way

REACH
------------------------
* vs push?
* active muscle engagement, elongating, outwards, inviting
* initiated from extremeties (fingers), penetrating (pointy, sharp)
* beginners usually move within kinesphere, especially when in contact; more advanced: extend, intention + attention into space

DEFINITION universal:

EXTEND
------------------------
* vs expansion?
* similar to reach but more
* can also be soft, no muscle tension needed
* extending without counter is like pushing without grounding
* add-on/plugin
* soft, wavey, from core outwards
* reach towards something, extend goes beyond
* reach has intention to aim for an object, extension can be by itself
* reach includes extension, but extension not reaching (?)
* reaching is aiming for an object in range, without moving the center; if further away, need to move
* extend is beyond the kinesthetic ability (send intention)
* elongate + intention going beyond the physical body = extend (a bit "la la land", not really physically doing it, but a mental thing)
* how's extending possible?
  * it's lala land; only mind intention
  * physically: reach to limits, then relax some (big) muscle fibers (keep medium/small ones), with bone-stacking
  * extending is not expanding
  * extending is possible from everywhere, but extremeties easiest; straight line (contral-lateral) easiest
  * e.g. in ballet they extend in a curved line
* extend not only from fingers (or toes) but with all parts of the body

LEANING
------------------------

BONE-STACKING
------------------------


IN COMPARISON
------------------------
* grounding: single (action, doesn't require someone/something else); push/yield: interaction (requires someone)
* grounding != lean/push; to ground = within my center; to lean = no skill, just unbalanced; to push = active, closed, tensed (and tension masks sensation)
* yield VS collapse
  * Y: localized, controlled, stay stable, always voluntary, maintain structure
  * C: extreme, global, dead, 0%, risky
* push is the opposite of yield; a continuum
* push + pull is adding tension; yielding is removing tension; collapsing is yielding without control
* pushing requires a counter-force, usually grounding
* yielding is the cousin of grounding, but more extreme
* yielding is contained on grounding (to gravitiy)
* pushing is the opposite of yielding
* yielding is purely passive, pushing is purely active (grounding is in-between)
* a soft push contains yielding
* grounding is controlled, yielding is collapsed; yielding is passive, pushing is active
* grounding is the prerequisite for sharing weight
* lean VS pull: leaning is off-balance, whereas pull is still grounded

EXERCISES
========================
* OBSERVE yourself, 4 qualities
  1) breathe: deep, conscious, don't hold it
  2) sense: your muscle tonality, e.g. when you are unbalanced, usually tense up; like doing a constant body-scan
  3) space: being aware of the room, the corners of it, the space between people, the people (big body), look out and away (not staring or looking down)
  4) interact: see the others, move with them, see/analyze where they are in those qualities, being playful/act
  * reflect now: what's your good/bad? comfort zone, and where not anymore?
  * some of the qualities might be there, but you are just not aware of them
  * we prefer a sinus-wave like manifestation of those 4 qualities: round, continuous; no sharp/unexpected/sudden/abrupt changes in it (spikes in the curve); yet again: you can break this rule if you know what you are doing, using it as a deliberate spice in a safe/controlled way
* ASSISTED GROUND
  * A pushes B down, helping him to be more grounded
  * B is in small dance mode
  * push down on (with both hands): feet, then hips/pelvis, maybe ribs, shoulders, head.
  * only vertically for now, slowly in/out, and symmetrical for now
  * CONTINUATION: now asymmetrical; e.g. one head other shoulder; B needs to compensate to maintain structure upright; B needs to rearrange (change (feet) position to stay); be aware of what the body is implicitly doing;
  * CONT: horizontal pressure as well; asymmetric
  * use hands first, then other body parts; transition into freedance
* not done, but also nice:
  * compress different body parts, squeeze them between hands
  * CONTINUATION: start to push horizontal, slowly (cat walk) change positions; imprinting a spiral movement possible
  * lean body against
  * ALSO: do it in trios: two partners use each one hand; then body parts squeezing between; transition free dance
* breathe-sense-ground exercise (same as from previous workshop)
  * first duo; partner dances in negative space, says "3-2-1-pause", then:
    * breathe: relax, soften
    * sense: bodyscan, detect tonus, awareness
    * ground: release, feel soles of feet
  * CONT: after grounding, push 2 vectors into partner's body to ground more; push into bone stacks, or to spice up also horizontally (spirals maybe)
  * VARIATION in trios: two dance, one rover saying same thing; dancers close eyes, rover touches point on each (only single finger, be precise!) and move from there
* back2back with 50cm distance, tap into small dance, slowly come closer
  * stay for same time here, share the small dance
  * slowly transition into free dance while maintaining that quality/sensitivity (unfortunately that "magic" is lost sometimes quickly/easily)
* simple exercise (no dance): with partner, one tells other to "collapse!", going down super quick (keep head tension for safety), give each other feedback/research
  * CONT: other command "yield", super slow on the ground down
  * CONT: also upwards (only yield, cant collapse upwards)
* partner negative space rover; gives commands: "pause" + { yield / collapse / push} (can also "halfway collapse")
  * pause implies breathe-sense-ground
* (gaga) tonality exercise: cement - honey - water - air
  * once we did it in duos; this time the whole group all together (teacher giving commands while dancing in quality; then "5...4..." and state new quality)
  * no speed difference necessary; air can also be slow, not only cement
  * do it even down to the fingers
* rover partner says "pause", then touch 2 points and command A) "move", then do like spiral or B) "tense" and each muscle separately/differentiated
  * connect those two points in whichever direction you want;  (be precise, take time!)
* "rod-chain" (stick-ricebag, yield-tense/superman)
  * 1) from little animal position or 2) from classical hip lift
  * easiest is belly, then sideways, most difficult from back!
* grounding with distraction
  * walking, some decide to do small dance (determine yourself)
  * eyes closed may be easier, open more difficult (distractions)
  * then walk again on your own will
  * goal: stay grounded while others walking around; keep sensation
* start with partner in very slow dance; pause every now and then: be aware of shared center of mass
  * move/play with it; consciously move it around, change its size
  * be conscious about 4 qualities
* bodywork-like: A lies like starfish, B pulls parts 1) upper leg 2) lower leg 3) foot 4) toes
  * then opposite arm 1) upper arm 2) lower arm 3) hand 4) fingers
  * then other cross-side
  * more proximal more pull strength, at very distal only little force; take time, nice fade-in/out
  * A tries to keep the extension of the body, keeps semi-relaxed, some yielding, but no "against" and no collapsing into it
  * imprint reaching sensation into A
* use lifting positions (little animal, classical hip lift, ...)
  * instead chain-rod exercise, now: reach, exhale, and extend further
  * CONT: spiral; and when land then yield+ground immediately
* roving-choreographer says "3-2-1-pause"
  * give 1 or 2 points; from there extend (to avoid not only from fingers/toes)
  * dancer take time, go slow, experience and research properly (be much in your head = present/conscious/aware/attention/focus)
* do basically same but in trio (third roving-choreographer)
  * giving 1 point each, move from there
  * after saying "3-2-1-pause", do the good old (but without it being instructed) breathe-sense-ground
  * difficult to stay connected with partner when starting to extend

OTHER
========================
* personal preference as images: i prefer dancing with scalpel, precise, elegant, fine, safe... not with hammers: rough, rigid, inaccurate, dangerous, ...
  * i like to dance with a jaguar, soft, gentile, agile, strong, quick if necessary, confident/humble/calm, playful, deadly; i don't like mosquitos, just hyper-active, barking like a little dog but nothing behind it just showing-off, pretending out of insecurity, unstable, no core/essence, boring and annoying with their little "meeeee" sound; i also don't like dancing with hippos, fat, slow, heavy, immoveable, stomping, insensitive tanks.
  * what does the personal like/dislike say about myself? my values/associations...
* difference beginner and master: master always knows the "why" (deeper understanding of the reason), thus also can divert from the norm/rules (break them deliberately, and still it's not a mistake/error/fault; risk-free, responsible); deliberate choice (circus bicycle clown like a beginner, because he decides to)
* awareness of other people around you, like in supermarket/walking in crowded places:
  * we (usually unconsciously) compute vectors, predict paths; too much for the brain to do it consciously
  * that's what we call the jedi-skill, like it is "happening to me"; trust it, let go, and pass control to unconscious brain part
* practice recovery techniques, when falling learn how to fall
  * e.g. upside-down, on back => super risky, solution: do a flip-flop! don't rescue from mistake/accident, but instead improvise (because that's what we do), accelerate/enhance it even (the only way out is through), use it as a source of input for a new, spontaneous inspiration for an unintentional movement.
  * being truly in the moment.
* the magic moment when "dancing with the big body"; dancing with everybody, secretly (without them knowing); feeling connected, belonging (spiritual practice?!)
* if you are too tensed, make "brrrr"-sound with lips to relax, keep the breathe active
* "semi-choreographer": the partner who is giving command; when dance with in negative space, also a "rover/satellite"

THEORY
------------------------
* a GUARDIAN ANGEL's howto:
  * stay close to the head of the liftee; stay in his visible proximity (he can see you, he feels more safe)
  * stay present, watch out, stay focused; don't get distracted, don't like somewhere else
  * stay engaged: don't cross arms but have them close to the head and move around continuously; move, don't be frozen
  * give feedback: either verbally (corrections, suggestions, questions, invite/challenge), or simply breathe yourself to help others breathing
* kinesthetic resonance: kind of empathy, mirror neurons, "i see you, thus i feel you"; your tension becomes mine (like yawning, irressistable!); speed syncs, we do it consciously or unconsciously (whether we want it or not, difficult to resist); like instruction to sense center of partner
  * like the "jedi skill" while walking: unconscious processing of information and responding to it (feeling the result, which simple-minded people call "energy" or assign some metaphysical-esoteric-supernatural phenomenon to it)
* justifying doing "whatever" by saying it's "improvised", then what are we doing?
  * like shiatsu: if it's everything, it's nothing. to define, we need inner/outer, boundaries, to say what it's not, so we know what it is.
* when we use "lala land words" like "the energy" (and we don't refer to the physically defined term), we do so due to a lack of better word, and "mean it seriously, but not literally"; it's like a tool; a nice story (christmas) or a movie: we enjoy watching it, without confusing it to be real (like a theater, someone dies and we don't call the police)
* ad anatomy:
  * bio-mechanical engineering concept: tensegrity
    * not muscle+bones, but connective-tissue + bones
  * "box" is area between ships (shoulders + hips)
  * add muscle contraction  (sarcomers, myosin/actin)
  * (many people don't know the word) tonality: we have a default (usual unconscious) level of muscle tension; we have a range to be able to play within
* if "the body always knows the truth" and "always trust (your) nature", how comes we have to work so hard to override our natural bodily impulses? e.g. tensing up, holding breath, looking down, ...
  * is it just a maladaptive behavior? when fear and fall, tension is like a muscle shield.
  * or psychological-trauma-fuckup?! as children trhough shit, now acquired ineffective impulses/behaviors. thus, as babies we were in our "true" nature, and everything was indeed always reliable (seems like a romantic fairy tale to me)
* be in HEAD and BODY: thinking focused on being present with physical sensations
  * being in the head; not only embody, but be conscious about it; to have deliberate choices to play with it; nothing is absolute (good/bad, just useful (or not) in specific cirumstances; like a hammer/screwdriver)
  * "you can only not do it, if you can (deliberately) do it" (violence/fighting in martial arts)
  * CAVE/watch out: we have a tendency to justify our inability and laziness by saying "i use my intuition, i don't need to learn this or that", or "i'm in the flow, i don't need to make an effort" or "i am here to have fun and play, not to work or doing exercises as it brings me into my head and i don't enjoy it anymore"; first work needs to be done to gain the harvest (anyone who's promising you anything else is most likely after your money and/or your body); there are no shortcuts
  * people want to be in the flow only, without doing the necessary hard work, but: to even increase the flow capacity, we have to do the work; the play/fun gets even better with the work being done
    * when in flow, things already need to be available in autopilot, which requires hard/conscious work before, no way around it!
  * balance: 80/20, where there is frustration on bad days, there is the potential for growth; we need effortful work, play will not bring us through those times (wrong tool); if you don't push through it but avoid, you will stay in the lower levels and not being able to see the beauty, the pleasure/fun/joy up high in the skies over the mountains
  * balance of yin/yang, think/feel, fun/work, flow/deliberate, ... have both available, to choose, no extremes, max 80/20, all relative, no absolutes; we need both (just tools)
* we don't divide attention, but multiple it; 100% inside, 100% partner, 100% space
  * it's like alternating current (electricity), or pseudo parallelism for CPUs through interrupts of scheduler)

SKILL/TECH
------------------------
* ad techniques: a spice is a spice; not too much, otherwise tastes bad. not too many different ones, otherwise tastes disgusting. technicals/lifts, just a bit every now and then.
  * beginners are impressed, intermediate are obsessed, the advanced look for the subtleties in the connection instead. they are spices, and as such, they ruin the soup if used too much. lifts are great, fun, challenging, but what we should look instead for is the depth in the basics, the principles, and the interaction with the partner, and less about how to add even more and more complex technical "hoopedipoop". that's good for the ego, good to show-off and good for the judges while performing in school or a competition, but in order to nurture the soul, we must go slower, go deeper, listen carefully, and see the little wonders within. as a teacher, i'd say: "don't show me all the fancy moves you can do, show me your basics, that makes me smile and appreciate watching you".
* TIP: on how to work on your core strength for the superman position (reach, extend, being a rod/stick):
  * use a big inflatable ball (gymnastics), and balance on it in straightened position (belly, back, sideways)
* basic principles violated often by beginners, esp. breaking the pathway (continuation).
  * insecure? front part avoidance? ....?  use arms (to change direction), easier not to interrupt; turn from horizontal to vertical spiral/plane
* SMALL DANCE:
  * being consciously aware of micromovements to keep the body in balance (posture, upright if standing). involuntary, unaware (usually), making it aware is the process of what's called "dancing the small dance".
  * being like a seismograph, sensing tiny erruptions which usualy go unnoticed
  * possible to dance the "big dance": tapping into the small dance, use those impulses as a source of inspiration to move, making those tiny micromovements bigger, exaggerate them, and let the small dictate the big
  * like trees in the wind (air), like seaweed in the stream (water), not-doing but allowing "it" to do you
  * observing without interfering, like watching your breath
  * unconscious micro-movements/reactions, becoming conscious, aware of them, which keep you balanced (in any posture, except fully lying down; is that so? how about the head for example?! maybe 100% indeed only in floating in water...); stacking bones, vector going straight down into the earth
* pathway continuation: allowing for smoothness/fluidity, give predictability, otherwise dance perceived as bumpy and not trustworthy (unexpected!)
* ability for discrimination of body parts: necessary for many things: rolling point of contact, spiraling, moving from a specific part, ... general body awareness skill
* quick/sharp movement, no octopus, dangerous! breathe out, relax, let go, surrender; BUT: keep structure, don't collapse!

SOCIAL/PERSONAL
------------------------
* sex differences: men are stiff, women are unstable.
  * men+men: afraid of intimacy (homophoby?), competition? little softness to surrender, more (play-)fighting
  * men+women: no egalitarism anymore, clear (social-stereotypical) rules (many (smaller) women are lifted against their will, grabbed; THAT's AN ISSUE!!!)
  * as a big guy: not being lifted at all (if dance only/mostly with women); then more like typical lead/follow roles
* giving feedback: how else shall we learn/grow/improve? how to do it? especially if i dislike something (smell, too fast, not listening, insensitive)? sometimes we don't know, so please tell, to be aware and have at least chance to change.
  * how to say "no" to an invitation (in negative space; no surprise to partner immediately jump to touch!), during the dance (stopping it)
  * is the "investment" worht it, to tell people? is it short-term then maybe not (like educating tourists about them being unaware of traffic; too many of them, and gone in a day again) or long-term (an ongoing class, then yes, you'll see them many times, so you will benefit from it); is it even changeable (smell, then tshirt/shower/perfume or is it his face, because surgery maybe not going to happen)
  * psychological plane: triggeres, projections; something is touching our own values (cultural differences, mostly unaware; we differ, but there are no absolutes); judgments... own them, express and not suppress. 
* different personality, different preferences:
  * dance by yourself/solo, distance with others, with dedicated partner, trio, group
  * easy-goingness with touch and intimacy (roll over front-side)
  * groundedness = calm, safe, confident,t rust
  * fast/slow, cold/firey
* finding a partner: can be tricky for some. sociometer/popularity thing, being liked/belonging; also male/female tension, desire, the thought of "is it allowed?"
* starting a dance (once partner is already assigned): start with negative space first, important! don't go in contact right away; in order to "warm up", like a foreplay, to get attuned to each other, synchronize, align, to agree to a style; otherwise will be more bumpy and difficult "to find each other"
* correct your partner non-verbally as much as possible
  * only if not working, then use words, say something (keep it short though, single word; like "breathe" or "ground" or "slow")
  * e.g. grounding => push them, if just moving away, push vertical (ground them; push pelvis)
  * e.g. pathway breaking => use bit more force/insist on the trajectory
  * e.g. stiff => speed up; e.g. wobbly/unstable => slow done
* dancing with a new/unknown partner; checking them out first: their skill & quality
  * for safety reason as well! not only to attune/sync each other, to improve the dance
  * e.g. don't fall into them, lean, off balance, otherwise both will fall; as partner without grounding can't support, unstable
