MISC
========================================================================================================================

GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BREATHE - BREATHE - BREATHE - BREATHE
  * all the time!!! in any position. don't hold your breath. and especially breathe OUT.
* GRAMMAR: quality (of movement/state of being), principle; more subtle
  * VOCABULARY: techniques, tricks, pathways; more concrete
* being in CONTACT or NOT? in old-school, lots of distance + impact play
  * today: tendency to stay permanently in contact; if distance happens, means immediately the end of the dance
  * is it possible to challenge this?! dance in negative space; to engage&disengage; dance in distance yet in "contact"
* FESTIVAL/multi-day workshop: bring enough shirts, very very important (super sweater); 2-3 shirts per jam
  * usually day 4 is where the exhaustion hits (day 5 = injury, as energy empty; day 1 = overly excited, also risky)

BEGINNERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAFETY:
* typical beginners mistake: grabbing with hands, and eyes closed
  * as usual: follow the rule, break the rule, become the rule (shu-ha-ri)
    * as an advanced, when you know what you are doing, you can do whatever you want
    * knowing the risks, deliberate decision to break the rule and take care of safety/compensate the risk)
    * manipulation isn't bad, grabbing can be a spice (later on)
  * hook/lock is not same as GRAB (chicken wing, munching pelvis (=chicken leg))
    * hooks are not a solution (usually), but a way of "cheating" (when e.g. off balance), a hack
    * it shouldn't be necessary, if done right (on-balance)
    * if base has sudden stops, the "water-body" (we are ~80% water) continues to move (inertia), will make you fall off
      * => use locks, or even better: extend limbs (as done in standing, use the "throwing momentum", that's more advanced/skilled than locks ;)
* INJURIES
  * they happen either because you have too much energy (overly excited and risk-friendly), or you have too little energy (tired, lazy, not paying attention)
  * if you do it long enough, you will see injuries; if you do it even longer, you will experience them yourself
  * those who had injuries (or at least seen them) are safe: knowing/experienced the riskiness of CI, thus being more careful
    * those who had no injury (or not even seen them) are unsafe: thinking it's all risk-free, thus being more careless
* beginners and advanced are safe, just the intermediates are dangerous
  * BEGINNERS: they know that they don't know (and can't) yet, they go slow, are humble
  * ADVANCED: they know their limitations (like beginners, are humble too), and when to break the rule safely
  * INTERMEDIATE: overly confident, risky behavior, showing off; insecure-arrogance; dunning-kruger effect
    * anti-dot: humbleness, open-mindedness; going slow! ask for feedback; be more precise; back to basics
* beginner's mistake: don't INVITE yourself on your partner
  * ability to say&hear a yes/no to/for an INVITATION for lifting
    * never force yourself on your partner (== invite yourself), but be slow, be perceptive, listen carefully, be with your partner
  * in the netherlands we make an appointment to meet, and not just knock at the door like a surprise-visit
    * thus, don't jump on your partner, heavy impact, unexpected, and potentially dangerous (and impolite)
  * the base decides a lift (usually); with already familiar partners, you may surprise them

DIS/ENGAGE:
* the FIRST DANCE, on an interpersonal level:
  * getting to know each other. start super slow and easy.
  * ASK questions (sending a clear and deliberate signal, e.g. manipulate or a clear dominate/active or submissive/passive move, offering/requesting a lift) and be super perceptive/susceptible for the answer (receiving a clear yes or no, thus inferring your partner's personality/preferences/dislikes)
  * it's like romantic relationships:
    * don't go too fast, don't over-invest in the beginning because you are super enthusiastic
    * instead be APPROPRIATE and PROPORTIONAL to what is (at the beginning very little, and build up over time)
    * check each other out, and let go of any prejudgments you might have, and empty yourself, free yourself, and let yourself be surprised.
  * even a small HANDSHAKE can reveal so much about the other person
  * how to start a dance: to make it clear/explicit: although usually not common, make eye contact (+smile) for a short moment
* the "other end" of starting a dance = ENDING it
  * make it clear, be honest and direct (matter of respect); e.g. namaste sign, say "thank you", or just "i prefer not to dance with you because ..." (moving too fast, i don't feel safe; i have a need for...)
    * feel free to give honest feedback, how else should we learn; we also would like to hear our mistakes so we can improve on them, instead of falsely believing we are flawless perfect beings in every aspect
  * don't use excuses, don't lie (e.g. have to drink some water), as otherwise people will come back to you (misunderstanding => conflict)
  * it's much about consent/safety, to do it right
  * after having disengaged, "shake it off" (arms or whole body), literally (physically) but also figuratively (psychologically)
    * sometimes, a quick body shake can be enough, to continue; like ginger in-between to neutralize the taste
    * intention to clear oneself from your "partner's energy", to reset, start fresh

TECHNICAL:
* SHARING WEIGHT: you are (almost) always too little, and never too much => dare to give more
  * yet, keep amount of pressure constant (measuring newton on point of contact should not change); tricky, thus go slowly
* NEGATIVE SPACE: regular "space", free space, opposite of positive space (occupied by body/person); VS kinesphere
* LITTLE ANIMAL:
  * is very alive, helps with, being active (we are never passive, more receptive/reactive); not like table-top position (static)
    * giving oomph, make arrival/landing easy by lowering parts ("runway")
    * making a "saddle" (hollow back, like when lifting, not arching it; concave/convex)
  * when going on little animal position, do exercise: "raging bull"
    * RAGING BULL can also stand up, lock is strong enough of flyer
* give your base TIME to find his structure (raul's air and bridge approach)
  * too early => he will collapse!
  * how to know (when it's the right time)? => simply look with eyes; when feel strong (unyielding) resistance; when in doubt, better wait too long than too short
  * as a base, take space, have a wide posture/stance (not too narrow)
* how to be a good GUARDIAN ANGEL (=to spot someone):
  * be ready, active, arms forward, walk with the dancers, full attention, watch out for head; talk, give advice, tap
  * don't have hands in hips, arms/legs crossed, look/have attention somewhere else

OTHER:
* STRENGTH VS technique: one can compensate for the other
  * strength has limitations and gets weaker the older we get, technique (sensitivity, alignment/posture, etc.) has none (infinite possibility to grow, to get more sensitive)
  * "what I lack of technique, I compensate with strength. the one who hasn't strength, must only rely on technique."
    * ultimately it's better to have both available if possible ;)
* ETIQUETTE
  * hair: self, if long, bind down (safety! when in floor work, being pulled); other: don't fuck it up, touch through
  * ad clothing: wear socks when spiraling/rotating a lot of standing on the floor upright, otherwise skin rips off due to friction of rotating


TECHNICAL (advanced)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* the SMALL THINGS matter: eyes, fingers, hands
  * if the EYES go down, we are in a state of hyperfocus (not good); we need to be more relaxed, look into the space
    * have a blurry, relaxed, peripheral vision with your surrounding (also safety wise important); catch all, non-focused
    * stay connected to the "big body", don't go into a hyper-internal-focus-state (ecstatic dance)
  * contact people vs contact dancers: 1) are amateurs, reach only until the wrist 2) are professionals, reach beyond the FINGERS
  * new animal "DEAD FISH HANDS": we are not active, not engaged. same with pilates/yoga/ballet/dancers: if the fingers reach, the whole body will be more engaged (same with good taijiquan practitioners, which only very few are able to do)
* problem of "always doing the SAME", STUCK in the same movement patterns / how to learn new pathways?
  * very common, especially among professional dancers (they dance with beginners to get inspired, as those are still freed from the limitations of a specific system)
  * solutions:
    * ask a partner to PAUSE you, touch a body, and move from there.
      * or let him control your body (e.g. remote control your head); surrender, and let yourself be guided.
    * SURRENDER, let your partner inspire/manipulate you
    * go very FAST (but watch: risky), as "in chaos lies creation" (creativity); like 5 rhythms, shiva.
    * when you are stuck with a familiar PARTNER ("shared patterns"), go find a new partner
* always ADAPT the technique (timing/weight-giving/positioning/...) according to your partner's weight/size/strength/age/...
  * everything changes; stay open, listen, have different partners
* ADVANCED topics/aspects to emphasize: tonality, breaking the bubble
  * TONALITY (ad anatomy): muscle tone/tonus, amount of tension in muscles; should be in the middle, flexible like a bamboo/rubber plastic; relaxed yet not collapsed; active yet not stiff
    * EXERCISE (from gaga): imagine as if you would move through air/water/honey/concrete
  * "breaking the BUBBLE": reconnect to what is going on
    * the bubble being: eyes down, going inwards, not being present with the environment (big body/space)
* motto "SOFT FEET make no sound": when walking/landing (no little elephants)
* how to build trust? pattern continuation principle: predictability, thus trust
  * also rolling of point contact principle: predictability, no "extreme octopus" (like from ecstatic dance, expression of chaos, no clarity, no trust)
* ways of LOOKING GOOD/impress/show-off (demonstrate):
  * collaboration/team work: if one fucks up, the other compensates (no passive/static posture)
  * cheating: use a lot of chicken wings/legs when off-balance
  * strength/use brute force: for compensating lack of technique

I) GROUNDING
========================================================================================================================
THEORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HOMEWORK: what is grounding for you? DEFINE it, write it down (it will change continuously anyway)
  * in terms of: weight / attention / intention
* grounding (down, relax, sink, breathe out) VS leaning (off-center, collapsed, plank) VS pushing (contract, stiff, stop breathing)
* grounding (can be up movement) VS heavy (weight, not mass) VS lethargic (collapsed, when tired)
  * 3 different things, subtle differences, but separate (like sharing weight/leaning/pushing difference)
* be strong/firm, yet soft/flexible; relax, breathe out, sink; not contract your  muscles (close them), but go down
  * "to invest into losing", let lose, surrender
* SMALL DANCE: feel the ground, automatic shifts of weight, subtle auto-movements
  * usually done standing, but it's there in any position, except when lying on the ground
* "SMALL DANCE PLUS": amplify the small-dance sensations (micro-movements), use as a source of inspiration
* developmental pattern terminology:
  * YIELD: into the ground; doing it physically to ground
  * PUSH: against the ground; doing it physically to ground
  * PULL: to the center inwards; doing it mentally to ground
  * REACH: outwards; doing it mentally to ground
* LITTLE ELEPHANT: sound when landing/stepping; indicates tension, no control (falling), unsafe/risky...
  * for soundless landing: relax, be sensitive, proper technique (shifting)
* MOTTO: "i trust you fully, and i trust myself more"
  * never just fall/lean on a partner without being able to catch yourself; always be able to catch yourself, never rely on others only
  * yet, dare to let yourself fall fully; trust, surrender, give weight; it's a sequence: fully trust, and afterward self-catch

PRACTICAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* EXERCISE: let your partner move freely, and sometimes say "pause" to pause them, and then say "breathe, ground, sense"
  * after a few seconds, when they did and felt did, they continue on their own again
  * add on: tell them additionally "slow/fast/up/down" and pause them
* TRI-POD: the foot can be separated in 3 parts (two front, one back); helps to get more grounding
  * EXERCISE: 1) just intention to move without moving 2) actually shift weight after intention initiated 3) move arm (first one, then both) 4) move them sharply, faster 5) do all but on one leg 
* EXERCISE: "double the grounding"
  * first start with a small-dance
  * then shift your weight from one to other leg, stay low (prepare to lift + spiral); toes keep touching the ground
  * not metronome like movement ("cutting the ground"), fixed-extended legs (not A shape but U shape, going low)
  * later necessary to walk as a base while partner is on top of you (instead of static lift and not move)
  * lastly add speed, spiral (in all 3 planes), without losing that quality


II) ROLLING POINT OF CONTACT
========================================================================================================================
* EXERCISE: partner touches 2 points, and you connect those (decide which one is starting and end point; A & B)
  * now imagine (use visualization) a line connecting those 2 points, and move through them (wave=simple, spiral=advanced)
  * add-on: do the same (touch 2 points), but now start with one point on the ground and roll on the floor to the other point
    * no jumping point of contact! imagine you are painting your body by touching the ground (some body parts are impossible; neck, armpit, knee pit); sometimes you need to be very creative/exploratory, rotating your limbs and "weird" positions to get there
  * it's all about learning bulging out every part of your body, to later on stay in (rolling point of) contact
* EXERCISE:
  * 1) lie on ground, starfish to shrimp (L/R) movement, and banana in-between; do it fast/slow
  * 2) barrel: lie sideways, roll other side, both arms/legs different "range", do it with pause (partner says); most difficult: close/open range; common mistake to push yourself from a limb, no! contract your limbs towards the center
  * 3) combine both, starfish and barrel; start with one or the other; or: barrel but with octopus free limbs


III) SPIRALS
========================================================================================================================
* HOMO- VS CONTRA-lateral
  * contra-lateral (opposite side): natural way of walking; exaggerate by doing a "catwalk" (swing arms, move shoulder blades/pelvis)
  * homo-lateral (same side): walking like a "penguin" (not to confuse with uni/bi-lateral)
  * also connect with those two: shoulders/hips, elbows/knees, wrists/ankles (when one bends/extends, the other does so too)
  * being precise is more important than being fast (if you can do it slow, you can do it fast; if you do it fast only, you can't do it properly)
  * add octopus quality to it + eyes into the space (no hyper-focus, but relax)
  * change for yourself the mode (be very deliberate in it): 1) homo 2) contra 3) free (octopus quality)
  * exercise: dance with partner, change yourself the mode (unnoticeable for the other)
    * plus: guess your partner's mode
* EXERCISE:
  * 1) stand, rotate your body, moving from : { feet, ankles, knees, pelvis, torso, shoulders, head }
  * 2) then activate hands to support/initiate; goal: priming of spirals
  * spiraling your arms crossing shoulder-height is difficult
  * 3) full spirals (use momentum of arms to rotate 360 degrees); playing with kinetic/potential energy
    * going down and up, more dynamic
* EXERCISE:
  * 1) from X-position (arms/legs) lying on the ground, turn on other side (belly-back)
  * either starting from fingers/toes, wrists/ankles, elbows/knees, hips/shoulders (be precise! don't cheat)
  * 2) let your partner pull you; creating a nice line through your body
  * 3) let your partner touch a point where from to move; easy ones (joints), difficult ones (bones), almost impossible ones (chest, face, arm-/knee-pit)
* EXERCISE:
  * from X-position, turn 90 degrees (plus turn on other side); one arm/leg goes down, other up
  * after 4 turns, you are on the same spot again; try to go fast and continuous
* EXERCISE: little animal: the other person "crossed-starfish"-technique over
  * either arm/leg first, either same-side/over ending
* spirals practiced on the ground: now apply them as flyer on a base being (hip-)lifted
* EXERCISE: on the ground, lying, do: 1) on-ground octopus 2) off-ground octopus (and keep limbs alive!) 3) banana
* EXERCISE "srolling": sliding + rolling
  * being on 90 degrees on the back of your partner, and the rolling (banana) while staying on the same place through sliding
  * sliding happens when the base is making upper body more upright (more vertical)
  * base helps a looot with arms and pelvis to keep flyer balanced

IV) CENTERS
========================================================================================================================
THEORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* floating VS grounding
  * FLOATING: levitation/center of leviathan, sternum; important "quality" when being lifted
    * not necessarily only up, but away/out(wards) from the center
    * fingers are related to light mass
    * (leviathan was a sea monster, bible, chaos/envy)
  * grounding: center/center of mass; chest/sternum up; base
    * direction down, and inwards/central (bones)
    * center (pelvis) is related with center of mass
    * use IMAGINATION: put center of mass in different body parts
* using quality of grounding/floating is always a useful way to express your yes/no to an invitation to be lifted
* BASE:
  * is alive/active, just like little animal, but now also while standing, with every lift (good gorilla!)
  * when entering, create "valley" (no mountain!); meaning: rotate plane sideways, towards partner, for easier access (launch pad)
    * also when going down, bend knees, so flyer is closer to the ground
* FLYER:
  * POURING weight (very important principle), don't jump (dangerous, big impact on base, and destabilizing)
  * find your center on the base yourself too (don't just be absolutely passive doll)
    * if being lifted on a taller base, make yourself bigger and go a bit on your toes (difficult for base to squad deep)
  * never bend both knees quickly when on base! shock on partner, disbalance, risky! (it's like jumping instead pouring)

PRACTICAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* EXERCISE: make the qualities/engagements of floating/grounding synchronous and asynchronous (inverted) while up/down
  * e.g. simplest one is look up/down, breathing, tension, pelvis tilt, bend/extending
* EXERCISE: with a partner: 1) focus on up 2) focus on down 3) focus on changing 4) free
  * see how it goes, as when both up, it's rather unstable (no lifts possible), etc...
* RELAXATION EXERCISE: mama+baby bear (plus bit back massage), change roles, rolling around, transition into (floor) dance, surrender and keep centers connected
* PELVIS mobility exercise: imaginary clock, move along, wide movement
  * e.g.: 6/12, 7/1, 8/2, 9/3, 10/4, 11/5, ... and also other direction; be super precise
  * first put hands on front below belly button + back on sacrum
  * then additionally have floating-octopus arm
  * this is important for being a proper base when lifting, providing a "launch pad" (valley) and also let him down smoothly (otherwise "jump down" necessary for flyer)
* EXERCISE: simple hip-lifts
  * front2back: flyer use chicken wing wrap around shoulder (lateral direction); base use hand on partner's upper leg to stabilize
  * back2back: first base goes down, head between scapula; then bend forwards and scoop (consider size difference!)
  * front2back diagonal: one moves upper body right, other left, and side-ways hip-lift
  * classical hip-lift: backend of base on flyer's chest, step in (same side leg)
    * move pelvis into your partner; flyer is leaning as a plank forward into (don't hinge from your pelvis; see acro-yoga)
    * other base's hand is doing a snap sound (hand other side as body moves) and arm stretched to indicate direction of flyer
    * offer a valley, by rotating your pelvis, look to the flyer
    * arms are guarding: hover one arm above the leg (offer as leverage, don't manipulate too much, don't grab), other arm below chest
* ADVANCED hip lift: side2side, opposite direction facing
  * embrace (hug) partner's pelvis bone (not too high), base moves pelvis forward and sideways, to be underneath flyer's (both try to find center-matching for on-balance position)
  * flyer leans backwards when invited, both have their safety "seat belts" on; flyer is back-bent (scary! breathe)
  * flyer spirals down; base tries to do steps to keep moving, and supports flyer to go down (slight manipulation/support)
  * CAVE: release arm early enough, otherwise it might dislocate
* KOALA lift technique: stay close to the partner and aim high! base goes down a bit, helps up, use chicken wing+leg
  * building on top of koala: shoulder lift: be able to kick (use "healthy amount" of momentum)
    * when going down, use a spiral movement
* EXERCISE: partner holds arms in, you push sideways open as hard as possible for about 20 seconds
  * then let arms float up "by themselves" => that's the floating quality we are looking for; remember this sensation during the float-dance (being light)
* EXERCISE: A moves freestyle, B says "pause - breathe - sense", and then touch 1/2 body parts, and A floats from those
* EXERCISE: in trio, C is dancing close in negative space; says "pause" A+B close eyes, and C touches each one point, from where the move/float from
  * when couple dances, the 3rd is a "rover", not just standing there, almost like "being in their aura", very close-by; being part of it, not just stand there, arms crossed
  * use this quality also during the "warm-up walking", or on the dance floor; secretly dance with everyone (and enjoy the feeling of belonging, not feeling lonely in a group, but being with everyone)
* EXERCISE: front2back, person standing behind lifts partner, wrap arms around his belly
  * 1) partner is neutral 2) partner is floating (light, easy) 3) partner is grounded (heavy, some kgs heavier felt)
  * then let your partner guess in which state you were
* EXERCISE SEQUENCE: typical hip lift + handstand (inner leg first; base is helping so flyer is rotated open a bit; watch out proper hand position) + shoulder lift
* EXERCISE: back-lift + handstand: hugging each other sideways (opp. direction facing), one lifts partner back, other makes handstand and flip forwards (away from base)
