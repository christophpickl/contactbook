Notes from Christoph Pickl

HOMEWORK
=================================================================
* provide definitions/think about for pelvis, centering, centering and how it relates to other concepts
* domain of physical VS. psychological (for CI more physical useful)
* definition styles: technical/anatomical/physical, narrative, image, examples, ...

PELVIS
--------------------------------------------------------
* plural: pelves OR pelvises
* look up a picture of a pelvis: almost shaped like an elephant with huge ear rings; sacrum being the head, nose the coccyx
* pelvis region: part between abdomen and thighs
  * bony pelvis (=pelvic skeleton):
    * sacrum and coccyx (=pelvic spine) at the back
    * anteriorly/lateral pair of hip bones
  * pelvic bones (=pelvic girdle):
    * ilium: upper part, big, the ears
    * ischium: lower-outer part of ear ring
    * pubis: upper-inner part of earring
* pelvic floor: below pelvic cavity; function: 1) keep organs up 2) control openings
* perineum (=pelvic diaphragm): below pelvic floor
* pelvic brim: plane/line between sacrum & public symphysis
* pelvic cavity: 1) greater/false above brim, 2) lesser/false below brim
* muscles: obturator int/ext, piriformis, iliacus + psoas, tensor fasciae latae, glutei, gemellus sup/inf, quadratus femoris, adductors
* the "whole" in the bones of the lower part: obturator foramen; functions:
  * 1: weight reduction; strong and light
  * 2: passage/protection for nerves/vessels
  * 3: muscle attachment site (obturator int/ext, hip stabilization/rotation, balance/mobility)
* pelvis = an integrated mechanical system, based on "tensegrity icosahedron" (polyhedron with 20 faces)
  * able to withstand omnidirectional forces; low-energy requiring system; favored by natural selection
* SIJ = Sacroiliac joint; very strong, supports whole upper body weight
* "obstetrical dilemma": locomotion efficiency VS birth canal width
  * women already at max possible width; men more optimized for bipedal locomotion

CENTERING
--------------------------------------------------------
* center (a location) / centering (verb, process of) / centered (state, positioned in)
* free associations: alignment, posture, stability, balanced, weight, stacking, proximal, awareness, space dimensions, calibration/adjustment, concentrated
* in construction: "a temporary structure to support a permanent structure (bridges/arches"
* psychologically: connected with oneself, calm emotions, slow breath, heightened sensitivity/perception, peace within chaos)
  * centering through breathing, gratitude/love, mindfulness, metta meditation (ACT), self-care
* being in the present moment, healthy coping mechanisms
* martial arts: act from a stable place (not lean out of the window too far, doing more than capable; staying true)
  * common mistake: the illusion of grounding by excessive use of force (YANG)
  * contracting, closing (immobile, unstable); instead of relaxing/sinking/dropping into the center (surrender, trust; YIN)
* definition: the process of shifting one's attention to a specific body part (usually more proximal)
  * more about attention (inwards)
  * where to put the center of attention (a specific body part, like hand, not necessarily dantien/hara/center of mass)
    * as if the ego-self awareness is not behind eyes but in that specific part
* shared center of mass becomes a single center: when 2 physical objects lean on each other, they have 1 center

CENTERING - and others
--------------------------------------------------------
* grounding + pelvis (?)
* centering vs. GROUNDING:
  * first center, then ground
  * grounding is different from centering
    * grounding is about: content who we are, confidence, certainty, minimum effort
    * grounding through: walk barefoot, earthy teas, regular physical activity, saying "no", self-reflect
    * grounding is (figuratively speaking): when human's center is connected to earth's center
  * center of mass is focused like in the center of a circle; grounding goes downwards into the floor
  * newton's 3rd law of motion: if two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions
    * i ground onto the earth, pushing with my mass (down), the earth pushes against (up). the earth pulls me down, and i her up (a tiny bit).
  * grounding as a specific instance of centering; which is: towards the feet, lowered into the floor/ground
  * through grounding => centering, through centering => core (connection)
* centered vs. BALANCED:
  * centered: more about intention
  * balanced: more physical (physiological, mechanical) thing
  * off-balanced... off-center.
  * balance: when the center is within "area of control" (like a 3D spot, the center, is within 2D plane on the ground)
* APPROACH: provocative questions to explore definitions/validity:
  * "can there be X without Y, and vice versa?"
  * use examples, answer intuitively, then extract/filtrate criteria/essence; conclude definition

GENERAL DANCE ASPECTS
=================================================================
* general remarks while dancing:
  * we already pay attention to the usual: breathe, look into space, fingers reaching/decorating
  * also pay attention to: 
    * keep grounding all the time when center-connection
    * monitor your own pelvis, and the one from the partner (spacial-visual image of its position, even without remote control)
* warm up exercise: "triangulation (triangularity?) of dance"
  * to feel and fill the space (with body+presence)
  * negative (air) vs positive (body, matter) space
  * start to meet other bodies, "grazing"
* technique "travelling": walking together through the room, being connected with the partner while doing so, negotiate how/where to move
* how to learn new patterns (and break/free from old ones):
  * have another person manipulate you, send impulses/info to move
* to be able to be controlled/soft (landing; stay relaxed) even though the unexpected happened; that's skill! advanced/mastery
  * often called "accident/mistake"
    * see improvisation acting, how to use it as a source of inspiration instead
    * mistake only if you see it as such; thought/interpretation creates reality
  * in short: how to improvise and deal with the unknown
* the jedi knight skill of knowing (consciously!) where my partner is. his center (of mass), in every given moment.
  * to be able to be there at the moment when needed; he's unbalanced, to support quickly, push him up again.
  * e.g., he falls, and i'll be there, just when needed; expecting it.
    * i keep (consciously!) track, having a visual representation of my partner in my head constantly running
* the purpose of walking-warm up
  * fire up attention, waking up, walking up, warming up
  * jedi skills training: becoming more aware of the unconscious processing of others as vectors on a plane
    * keeping track of pathways/positions; trust the computing power within and act upon it (gut feeling/intuition)
  * keep moving continuously without a break; spiral down/up/around if necessary; don't stop/freeze; also a psychological thing (breathe)
  * soft (smart) feet, no sound (little elephants), relax (like in quadrupedalism, landing softly with "smart hands", reaching fingers)
  * body scan: include whole body while moving with octopus quality; soft, all-encompassing
  * connect with others (look, smile), and the space/room (feeling home, arriving)

GROUNDING
------------------------------------------------
* EXERCISE partnered...
* 1: connect to partner's center only visually; sense it, imitate from afar
  * add imitation: only pelvis movement, not arms or other things
    * also, feel free to "freely reinterpret" a bit, and not be 100% technical correct
      * grasp more the quality of it (also notice when cheating yourself if you cannot do it and want to feel better about yourself ;)
* 2: remote control: first oomph (really strong!); imitate the (pelvis) movement
  * start slow and simple, then challenge each other; do "the clock", rotate/tilt; be clear and clearly differentiate
  * first straight lines, then "closed circles", then free/endless, lastly fast and wild (stay in the proximal zone of development)
  * watch your other hand, is it clinching a fist? try to relax everything
  * as the remote control: pay attention to your partner, what you do and the impact on him.
    * e.g., rotating very fast you'll lose him; not doing just your own thing, but do it together, serve, be with the other person
* 3: without partner: dance freely in space
    * approach someone in negative space - engage with remote control - disengage - repeat
    * no "trains" please: multiple people in a row; quickly detach if someone attaches on you while being attached yourself 

PELVIS
=================================================================
* for pelvis mobility: do monty pythons silly walk during warm up
* EXERCISE: show pelvis to your partner. she's touching yours. exploring it.
  * first get consent, what's ok, what isn't. go deep into the bone tissue.
    * follow all the structures of the pelvis on all sides. get an internal visual representation of it.
  * also, choose to completely step out of this exercise (anxiety, intimacy, fear, boundaries).
  * use a fabric, and put it like a diaper, back-front, covering anus and genitals (if wish to do so).
  * maybe also touch your own, then compare it with your partner's
* EXERCISE: draw pelvis on paper
  * 1x (1 page) the anatomically/technical correct one (as much as you can/know)
  * 1x (another A4 paper) a creative/artistic version of your interpretation of a pelvis
    * hand-out paper and pen, put them in a row on the edge of the room
  * after finished drawing, show the "proper solution" and do a group sharing
  * then do a sharing with your partner; reflect
    * what was easy/difficult. how is it now (your understanding of pelvis)? compare with your drawing.
  * also know: where the psoas is connected (L1-L5 and proxi-medial femur); obturator foramen; where the main artery goes through; etc.
* EXERCISE: stand, small dance, feel femur bone
  * explore: try to be one-legged; use muscles instead of structure; play with different positions
  * then go down to the FLOOR: 
    * roll on the floor, feel the bone structures and pelvis skeleton (femur, trochanter major, ilium/ischium/pubis, sacrum...)
    * research for 3 highlights, and once done, share it with same partner (as before).
* it IS possible to have a rolling point of contact while on the floor with the pelvis; need to be super relaxed though
* partner exercise: have your hands around the pelvis bone of your band; stand behind them
  * A: standing
    * 1: ground them first by pushing them down at pelvis bone (typical grounding exercise)
    * 2: they move, you follow their movement (only passive! no manipulation, yet)
    * 3: occasionally send impulses yourself (receive 80%, send 20%)
      * partner decides: go with it or resist it deliberately
  * B: walking together
    * follow partner at first; listen only... let him do freely.
    * then occasionally send counter-impulses; play with saying "no" occasionally; "sumo fighter" mode
    * then partner always has to say "YES" to it (the best way to learn new movement patterns)
      * play with very soft impulses, very light/subtle
  * ADDON: only give touch impulses, let go of constant touch
  * ADDON: use your legs/pelvis/center to manipulate (instead of hands)
* pelvis mobility EXERCISE:
  * walk the cat walk, like models to, exaggerate pelvis swing
  * then extremely isolate the pelvis, no movement in the shoulder
  * then only shoulders
  * then both
  * then none; just regular walking; experience how easy that is
  * CONT: walk next to a person. feel/sense their center
    * engage and disengage with several people; play a bit
    * then touch-contact via shoulders only, walk next to each other for a while
    * then take a 180 degrees turn by using rolling point of contact
* solo EXERCISE: pelvis (girdle) and upper body (shoulder girdle) separation
  * 1: move them freely together
  * 2: one is leading the other (switch)
  * 3: one is moving, the other totally still (switch)
  * put your hand on your lower belly and the other on sternum (switch hand, as we have one dominant)
    * first close your eyes, then move both parts
    * then walk... (find a partner)
* start back2back, shoulder blades have contact, dance there 1 min (give weight)
  * then change contact to pelvises, send impulses (with pelvis/from center) just as we did with hands before
    * A: rotational push (1 side), spiral/turn
    * B: linear push, straight; advanced: wave motion
    * C: combine both (super advanced)
    * + use upper legs to manipulate/"pedipulate" (good balance required)
* pelvis clock advanced exercise: in all 3 planes
  * build-up: do body scan, apply the clock on the floor, and with this sensitivity apply with partner (floor dance)

FLOOR WORK
=================================================================
* floor work is very advanced, even more than little animal and standing lifts!
  * focus on maintaining center connection (use chicken legs/wings)
  * keeping pathway continuation
  * requires lots of core strength (yet soft, relaxed)
  * being aware of people around you (safety)
  * way more intimate, need to feel comfortable with it
* floor work exercises often lead to bruises (esp. at the hip bones). that's ok, it will go away.
  * motto: "blue bones are ok, broken bones are not"
* EXERCISE: free dance, try to have 30% of the time center2center connection (use no hands!)
  * monitor your own pelvis, pay attention to it
  * also be able to quickly connect to your partner's (when you "sense" it, you know where it is in space, and immediately go for it)
* group EXERCISE: in trios, discuss definition and relations; present group-result to big group; plus discussion
  * define "centering" (similar as did in previous workshop with grounding/yielding)
  * also: how centering relates to grounding
  * => see homework of preparing definitions
* floor EXERCISE/core workout:
  * 1: starfish-shrimp (with partner-teacher); first slow then fast
    * watch out for mistakes: lifting limbs (always on the ground), bending limbs (have them stretched out)
    * CONT: partner gives oomph on lower belly (below belly button)
      * push down while partner on back, and then towards yourself (partner rolling "away side") to give a bit of a counter-push
  * 2: starfish-ball: lie on the back, starfish position; then quickly contract to the smallest ball possible (even with head)
    * do it very fast; also going down again; stop 1 cm before the ground, and then land softly (without any sound!)
    * watch out to do it not too often, as your iliopsoas might hurt quickly (right after, or next day)
    * CONT: partner touches belly, which is the signal to do it; like a heavy ball dropping onto you
* teacher-partnered EXERCISE:
  * build core strength and yet keeping relaxed... soft yet strong; taijiquan iron-wool metaphor
  * doing octopus on the ground; start with 2 commands: UP (hands/feet always off floor), DOWN (hands/feet always touch ground)
  * teachers are the helmet for the partner, so they don't get kicked!
  * CONT: add command PAUSE (freeze for a moment; that partner decides self when to continue)
  * CONT: after pause, add 1 point where partner moves from
  * CONT: now add 2 points
  * tip: observe your partner carefully and touch point where he seems to have a "gap/blind spot"
* TRIO exercise:
  * 1 on the floor lying, 2 are the "standing obstacles"
  * obstacles step around, blocking the path (with firm legs)
  * person on the floor tries to get through obstacles while using the same skill of octopus up/down before
    * don't lift center/pelvis from ground; don't grab; leverage/hooks are ok
  * it's not about "winning" (shows your personality)
    * also not about challenging yourself so much; explore also the easy solutions; experience the full range
* EXERCISE: from starfish, to shrimp, to little animal (and crawl sideways)
  * arm+leg in direction where you want to go, go down first
  * variation: reach into that direction with arm+leg goes into that direction (as if someone would pull you); keep it extended (no shrimp)
  * if there is a little elephant sound here while landing, it will mean danger later on
  * CAVE: in little animal, head always above ass. also now when "going up"/transitioning from lying position.
* EXERCISE body surf:
  * idea for pre-EXERCISE: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise
  * tip for base: push into leg to start roll if partner is on you, otherwise difficult to engage only from core
    * keep periphery always on the ground; as did before
  * CONT: do it in trios: 1 base and 2 surfers (they run behind quickly to make it continuously)
  * how much weight? depends on { partners size/weight/strength }; 40-80% (not nothing, rarely everything)
    * base needs weight for keeping momentum of rolling; to maintain connection
    * when it has to be only 10-30%, always be with your belly on your partner, to be able to take weight off into hands/feet
  * CAVE: fast movement (=heavy weight) on floating ribs is one of the most common injuries in CI
    * prefer to roll over pelvis and lower back; especially pelvis can carry a LOT of weight
  * keep limbs on the ground (also nice to push a bit), as doing the barrel will not give you much/any strength

LITTLE ANIMAL
--------------------------------------------------------
* little animal: hollow back, we call "saddle" (no mountain)
  * also don't bend the back too much, as it will strain your back muscles
* EXERCISE little animal:
  * flyer just balance on your partner; 1) on your belly 2) on back
  * 1: try to go on with headstand; 2: then off (or handstand)
  * do the typical aikido roll continuation
* Plus-EXERCISE: starting by body surfing, and then base moves into little animal
  * lying next to each other, base one leg bent, flyer reaching over with straight leg
    * easier if future-flyer is sitting up (hands to the back), more difficult if lying down
  * PLUS: flyer lying on belly (instead of back), with spiral will then be on back flying
  * RESEARCH question: as base, the "front-side" arm-leg, should it be bent (as do in the "dry practice") or extended (as I'd do)?
* find trio, go into little animals (or monkeys, bear position walking)
  * one person "jumps softly" on other animals, with legs first (both at the same time; otherwise it's just climbing)
  * experiment maybe with: spirals, going over 2 animals, ...
* EXERCISE: animal cross over with headstand: land with "superman pose" ;)

LIFTS
=================================================================
* EXERCISE: hip lift (trio)
  * 1: guardian angle pushes flyer on hip bone (ilium) to spiral down; flyer extends leg, reaching, use core muscles
  * 2: then base is pushing with the own hand the flyer "open"
  * 3: flyer does himself and with help of the base, moving his pelvis, but using no hand
  * 4: lastly, flyer is doing just by himself, with little/no help from base
  * if flyer is too much weight towards the head, it will be impossible to "climb the mountain"
  * short break... teacher sharing insights to the group, mistakes he observed, giving advice how to improve (solutions+cheats)
  * lift partner again and now continue making steps (less static/exercise-like)
    * lower your partner, stay connected (principles!), and lift again, continuously
* reversed hip swing-lift
  * similar to as standing side-by-side (facing opposite) lift, but now not hug belly front but from the back
  * stand not entirely next to each other, but a bit in front/back, so landing on pelvis will be easier
  * pull partner, flyer's outer leg, and do it continuously both

ACRO YOGA expedition
=================================================================
* typical plane basics (in trio, with guardian angel)
* CONT: 5 people together, 1 guardian above head again, 2 on the sides, those 2 take the arms/wings of the flyer
* "raging acro yoga": base constantly pushes into groan
  * flyer goes "in/over flyer", maybe be pushed sideways by base
  * bit fighting, lots of oomph, a little bit of childlike playful wrestling
  * CAVE: flyer legs not extended (weight goes forward and base has no grip anymore)
    * base not fully extend either (backflip danger)
  * after some time, try to push flyer into a spiral, then go:
    * A) into body surf or B) into little animal, and immediately initial position again

MASTERY
=================================================================
* danger comes from a discrepancy between risk and skill
  * risk: speed, technical show-offs (lifts), distance
  * skill: precision, control, awareness, presence, experience
  * 1: a beginner: low on both; is safe; they know what that they don't know, they don't risk things; are modest
  * 3: a master: high on skill (confident, grounded; no need to show-off), and a bit lower on risk (slow down)
    * modest, safe: they know that they don't know
    * has seen/experienced injuries, no unnecessary risk and plays within his boundaries/limits (he is aware of and respects)
    * calmed themselves in their eagerness (long journey of doing the impressive/shiny techniques, bored by it, back to the basics)
    * if go faster/higher: first read the ability of the partner (slowly increasing), do it with consent
  * 2: an intermediate: irresponsibly higher risk than skill, the risky ones
    * overly eager (childish enthusiasm), not yet experience with injuries
    * over-estimate their skill (dunning-kruger effect victims); show-off, insecurity, puberty men
    * avoid "risky intermediates": they have not sufficient skill yet and are overly eager, hyper-focused on techniques/lifts; show-offs
* before the class, what to do?
  * sit, play with phone? lie on ground, do nothing; stretch, do yoga, ballet? walk around, do handstands; or dance?
  * question is: is it really what you need, or do you feel it's more like a habit/fear-avoidance/adapting to the norm?!
    * same as before your ordinary yoga class: everyone in their own -phone- bubble
    * needing a teacher to tell them what to do; independence? self-sufficient?!
  * is it a true, deliberate choice? or just "not otherwise possible"?
* modes of doing an exercise:
  * 1: research: serious, depth, progress, focus, development, curiosity, growth, mastery
  * 2: play: fun, enjoyment, happy, light, smile, pleasure, hedonistic, win-win
  * 3: fight: competition, eagerness, motivation, against/counter, proving, showing-off, reassurance/validation, win-lose
* pathway continuation + rolling point of contact:
  * principles to adhere almost dogmatically (100% perfect)
    * also from a pragmatic perspective: it's practical, it's smoother, more fluid/fluent, continuous, round...
  * only break it, if you can stay with it 100% (again: a conscious choice = freedom = mastery)
  * skill, precision, awareness, knowledge (of those principles), control, softness
* it's very useful to use some anatomy (not in its most details though)
  * especially functional anatomy (movements, biomechanics) for body workers/dancers/sports/teachers/etc
  * otherwise, you will stay semi-professional at maximum...
* while lifting: always be able to give the reason, the WHY; and also show/know the way how to do it CORRECTLY
* the base/foundation/essence: balance/grounding
  * no falling but pouring, no little elephants but "smart feet" (soft, controlled)

BEGINNER's MISTAKES
--------------------------------------------------------
* extreme masculine:
  * jumping on the partner, instead of pouring; it's not nice, no flow and dangerous (impact; shock to the partner); forcing it
  * domination: grabbing, instead of inviting (for a lift); taking away autonomy (rude), but also not safe; using force
  * overly tensed up; no breathing/relaxation; "closing" the muscles, having them working against you
* extreme feminine:
  * collapse, being unstable, not grounded, extreme surrender; "just being in the body" (fear of thinking)
  * fully passive, taking no initiative, no conversation happening just a monologue
* flyer's mistakes:
  * flyer jumping on base, instead of pouring weight; base shall not feel the "lift-off" (can also practice going on little animal)
  * flyer is bending legs, making an "iron ball"; super heavy for base; it's a fear reaction, extend/relax
  * flyer is overly contracted, "closing" muscles, tensing up, stop breathing, shiver (like with TRE exercise); usually men
* base's mistakes:
  * bad VS good gorilla:
    * 1: base having head below ass; flyer will fall down forward => head above ass
    * 2: base having an arched back (yoga cat)
        * flyer will not be able to have a surface where he can balance; fall down backwards => do a hollow back (yoga cow)
  * base is bending his pelvis forward, disconnecting instead of staying connected; sharing weight throughout
  * don't be a static/dead animal/base, but be alive/active:
    * lower your pelvis, bring her down, closer to the ground; otherwise flyer drops on the floor (little elephant)
    * create a "ramp", and lower one side of the pelvis (see clock exercise)
* find together the right amount of going down/up to find center
  * base doesn't go down too far, bend knees too much, unnecessary, most have not enough strength to get up again.
  * flyer shouldn't need to go on the toes (only if the height difference huge, and the base lacks strength to go low)
* don't grab your partner (especially as base; you can seatbelt them, but not pull like in acrobatics)
  * instead spread your wings, provide support and leverage possibilities (flyer decides whether to use it)
* ad closing eyes:
  * beginners like to do that (comes natural) to increase interception
    * remove visual external perception; seeing takes a lot of brain CPU, BUT it's not a solution/goal
  * for safety reasons: don't do it! you will bump into others/objects; accidents, injuries!
  * also: be able to have that same level of perception with eyes open (as you would with eyes closed)
* anti(dot)-beginner's mistake:
  * saying "no" when he wants to grab-lift me => lower/drop my center, making myself heavy
    * TODO: how do light, small women do that?
  * saying "no" to what is, being true to myself:
    * e.g., with upbeat music and i'm sad/melancholic, i stay slow and sad
    * same with partner: he's fast and risky, I stay being slow and safe
  * use little cheat tricks to compensate for mistakes (aka "kiddie wheels")
    * as flyer, push into base's legs (similar as with shoulder lift, push into upper body)
    * use chicken wings/legs to rebalance
    * basically use leverage and pushing to fix unbalanced position

SOCIAL
=================================================================
* talking is often an excuse to not feel/sense
  * an escape mechanism like (fake) humor/jokes/smiles, to cover up what is
  * attempt to get rid of the discomfort, and not staying with what is; fear of depth/intimacy/vulnerability?! blocking progress/growth
* finding a partner:
  * anxiety evoking for some, totally easy going for the other
  * observe your own tendencies, monitor yourself, without judgment
  * getting chosen or do you choose?
  * who are the ones you like, and those you dislike? (why? what does it say about you? why does it bother you?)
* how to choose the right/a safe/skilled/fitting partner?
  * he needs to be balanced and grounded (no little elephants; landing controlled; small and soft steps, smart feet)
  * use the warm-up (before class; walking) to check out people's movements
  * while dancing:
    * adheres principles: giving sufficient weight for support; rolling point of contact (predictable, no (bad) surprises); pouring weight (no jumping)
    * healthy collaboration; no pure lead (toxic masc) or follow (toxic fem)
* when doing a partnered exercise, don't just "do something" but clearly think about it (and observe) what and why you do it what you do
  * where are the weak spots of your partner, and give stimulation there
  * don't just go wild and crazy, but pay attention to whether your partner is still following (zone of proximal development)
* the dynamics in a dance:
  * solo: i can do whatever (monarchy, xi jinping)
  * duo: i could overrule with my intention, force (fake democracy)
  * trio: impossible to manipulate. full-on listen-only (minority in democracy)
  * ... "strange", other people have needs of their own. they have a will which i cannot control/dictate. cumbersome...
* the social/group-dynamics realm "underneath"
  * observe, e.g., who dances (how) with whom
  * who cuddles with whom, who's cozy, or not at all; feeling safe, intimate; who anxious/unsafe?
  * when there is a little elephant/screaming/bumping - always the same people?
  * "same stays with same": old/young, beginner/advanced; even same hair type, clothes, ...

PSYCHOLOGICAL
------------------------------------------------
* qualities of movement = personality reflection
  * dancing wildly, unpredictable, for those who trust more + are risk-inclined (or just not enough experience yet?!)
  * observe your own tendency in both roles; more passive/active; listen/manipulate; follower/lead
* "to be in my head", yet again people struggling:
  * what is meant by it? being distracted, unfocused, useless/unproductive thoughts?! (focus/attention on the body happens in the mind...)
    * to have (self)doubt, criticism, unworthy feelings provoking thoughts, insecurity, judgments, dissatisfaction
  * embrace it (don't try to suppress, judge as negative, what must go away, the enemy. to resist is to persist anyway; see christian's sexuality)
    * find the valuable treasure underneath, it wants to tell you something; there are no "bad emotions/thoughts"
  * we need to focus a lot; analyze steps, be aware of what's going on
    * being deliberate means to be safe; to be in the present moment with thoughts and feelings/emotions
    * attention on physical sensations; control; in a relaxed and balanced manner
    * heart & brain (think & feel, men & women, yin & yang), joining, not suppressing one or the other
  * overly thinking? inability to focus! instead, try to focus fiercely on an aspect which is relevant right now.

CI THEORETICAL
=================================================================
* modern CI is flowy, slowly, continued connection
  * old school CI is very "stormy" (only for advanced people who know what they are doing and are skilled)
* why do people come to CI: what's their intention/motivation? possibly:
  * fun/play/enjoying themselves
  * socialize/anti-lonely
  * a fun way of workout, sport, physical activity
  * finding a romantic partner/love/sex
  * personal/psychological/spiritual growth
  * becoming better/to study/work/practice/research
  * dance/expression/art/aesthetics/beauty
* basic protocol to adhere:
  * no shirts with buttons (you might get stuck); also no jewelry (ear rings, necklaces, rings...)
  * wear comfy pyjamas instead. we don't dress to impress ;) we are authentic and humans just as we are
  * no sleeveless shirts (yeah, you look cool), but for hygiene’s sake
    * also no sliding possible with skin (long sleeves better)
    * best bring multiple shirts anyway (sweaty)
* when demonstrating something as a teacher
  * slow very much down
    * people need to see clearly
    * my performance will be more correct/precise
    * don't show off! ego stuff, not appropriate here
      * it's a show-off itself to be able to do it slowly (and precise) as well
  * turn around in different directions
    * so people see from different angles (people usually circled around, not on 1 line)
* OPEN QUESTION: two different ways to ground: through weight and through tension???
* OPEN QUESTION: the t-shirt mystery: why does it always move up when doing floor work/rolling???
  * possible reasons: shirt specifics / the movement itself / the body shape
* mottos:
  * "slow down, to be able to listen"
  * "you need to weight/wait, so to fill/feel your pelvis bowl/ball"
  * "you can only say yes, if you also can say no, and vice versa"
    * break the autopilot (the unconscious mode), this leads to freedom, to choice
      i can only be smooth, if i can be edgy; doing the opposite; slow/fast, soft/hard...
  * "fewer lifts, more pepper"
  * "smart kids 'pubertize' better"
