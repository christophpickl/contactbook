TO*DO list
==========

! start each chapter with a mini abstract (what is it about) AND especially how it relates (why important/useful) for CI

* not jump on partner while being lifted, risky injury impact. pour weight. or use momentum.
* safety, dont use hands to manipulate, later yes. also pedipulate.
* anatomy, 33 bones spine (?), 27 foot (?), hand,... in total bones/muscles
- homo/contra-lateral
- not only sharing weight, but also sharing balance (not "off balanced" but "shared balance")
- mostly through core connection (center of gravity)
* => current RESOURCE working on: https://contactquarterly.com/contact-improvisation/about/index.php
* movement qualities: grounding VS levitian (base VS lifting); yield-push, pull-reach,... (muscle tonus; water, honey, concrete); kinesphere size (small/body, medium/ellbow-knee, large/wrist-ankle, extra-large/finger-toe, universe/projectingoutwards), tension (water, honey, concrete), speed (slow/fast), body parts (homo-/contra-lateral, upper/lower, left/right side); roundedness (stachato edgy vs air flowy; a la 5 rhythms); moving up (standing) down (ground) and in between (all fours)
* add a bit about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesiology
* dancing on the ground (lying, little animal) vs standing
* harvest from this page (laban especially): https://annemarleen.gitbook.io/immersive-design/embodiment/gestural
* => ask in tom's whatsapp group for volunteers to review this booklet
* ... add more techniques stuff
* kinesthetic resonanze (mirroring movements). yawning? "to feel the other person's energy"?
