* roles during practice:
  * rover (also "satellite"): dancing around in negative space, no physical contact (touch), but dance with, being engaged
  * (semi-)conductor: giving instructions what to do, to either single other person or a duo; zone of proximal development (learning zone, not comfort/panic zone)
* grammar (=principles) vs vocabulary (=techniques)
  * basic principles: grounding, sharing weight, pouring weight, rolling point of contact
* Levels of Contact (Depth); Layers:
  * Skin - Muscles - Bones
    * just an arbitrary but easy to work with distinction
    * not meant to be taken literally; e.g. elbow almost immediately bone touching... more about pressure/tension: light - medium - heavy/hard
  * EXERCISE from osteopathy: hand onlying partner, take loooots of time, going through layers: fabrics clothes, hair, skin, fat, blood vessels, fascia, muscles, fascia, bones... and all the way back again.
  * first stand (then walk), change depth of contact with feet on the ground
    * engage in center of gravity/levithian for this
    * basically amount of tension in body, releasing (pressure) into the ground
  * sensation while standing/walking/with partner:
    * SKIN: like walking on thin ice; on egg shells, careful; no sound = soft feet
      * like a feather, just touch, no weight
    * MUSCLE: something in-between skin-bones;
      * sharing weight (regular quality)
    * BONES: full relaxation, heavy, rooted
      * active push (not a fight though)
  * usually sharing weight (and grounding), is between muscle+bones (where our style is mostly in; other CI styles may be softer, or even harder)
    * different dance-regions/cultures have different default-depths
    * ours more heavy; no right/wrong, but different, know those differences, pros/cons
      * more weight is also more connection; or is it?!
      * is it more advanced to feel same (center-) connection with less weight (skin contact)?
      * technically not really possible to feel center, yet necessary, maybe still some communication possible?
  * a jump (when being lifted) : can be either soft (yes) or hard (not preferrable)
    * hard: creates a gap/distance for a moment, leading to high impact, and risk for injury (surprise)
    * soft: stays connected with the partner all the time
    * jumps used to quickly travers through layers (skin to bone)
  * to connect with partner, we first need to sync our depth levels (both in same)
    * otherwise not meeting each other (one pushes the other away)
  * EXERCISE: dance and have different levels with different body parts; be super conscious about it
    * easily tempted to use sliding contact with skin touch; try to stay with rolling point
  * EXERCISE: trio, 1 in middle, 2 other adapt to depth level (qualities of contact) of one in the middle
  * depth relate to tonality
    * SKIN: air, relaxed (but not caressing)
    * MUSCLE: water/honey, active tonality
    * BONE: concrete, slow, very big angles/round, tense
  * oldschool CI: going from no contact into bone immediately; basically a (risky) clash
* AD SAFETY:
  * "no risk no fun", true, and: "too slightly much risk, never ever/no more fun at all anymore"
  * in a blink of an eye, it all can be over, never movement possible for the rest of your life
  * going too fast, too risky, too eager, too unfocused, not paying attention... better safe than sorry
  * we take it for granted too much, our health, our ability to move, to live without pain, our independence to manage daily life without external help
  * only when injured/sick we are aware of it; like IT infra/admins: only when it doesn't work we are aware of the amount of effort to keep it running, and how fragile it actually is; more gratitude for what is, less frustration when it isn't
* intimacy is (more) about intention, not so much about observable, physical behavior 
* the floor (ground) is always a partner as well
  * a duo is actually a trio (2 people + 1 floor)
  * consciously decide depth with floor/partner

* WHY small dance:
  * 1. To bring to awareness the unconscoious movement that shape the process of balance.
    * - become more aware; later "unconscious concious"; sensitive awareness; better perception for small movements; survive a fall, where is my body in high velocity; usually done in standing, but can be done in different positions (except lying).
    * - keep the awareness of these shifts also in dance; to compensate weight, predicate weight/movement will come
  * 2. To ground and sensitize your perception
    * - why grounded? otherwise impossible to stay (perceive; psychological element) in the here and now. otherwise can be pushed/moved, turned out oneself easily
  * 3. To feel and relax unnecsesery tension, and to feel what in this sturctre tensegrity holds the architecture of your form.
    * - come to minimum effort/tension, more sensitive (tension masks sensation)
    * - create structure, to be more stable
* ad "good/bad gorilla": simply yoga's cat-cow ;)
* ad about/intro:
  - drugs (illegal ones; weed, XTC/MDMA, cocaine), supposedly "plant medicine" (toxins/poisonous substances; ayahuasca, magic mushrooms/truffles) or legal drugs (psychoactive substances; alcohol, coffee, tabacco)
    - alcohol: rotten stuff; mushrooms: defense substance not to be eaten; LSD/cocaine: a funghi
    - many romantic associations with "natural drugs" (vs artificial ones); only what can be plugged and eaten (to eliminate cocaine)
    - is it a drug or a medicine? does makes the poison? a political thing. it's a molecule, and on that level there is no discrimination (good/bad, drug/medicine, natural/artifical); in the end, everything gets somehow "processed" (in the guts), so what's the difference natural/artificial anyhow?
    - even breathwork, esp. holotropic breathing, pushing the body out of its homoestasis, fighting against it; basically a blood poisoning by dysbalancing the oxygen-carbondioxide proportion
    - how about physical activity?
      - sex: super healthy, no side-effects, but can also be very addictive and it requires (at least) a partner to be available
      - cuddles: also super healthy, but unfortunately in our society it is limited to a single romantic partner, and we don't allow ourselves to cuddle with anyone else outside of such an engagement
      - sports: can have some positive effects, but usually conventional sport is not emphasizing any psychological aspects where one would feel similar positive effects ("high") after a good sex-cuddle session or any substance-intake
      - dance: besides that it may require some skill (and money to pay for lessons), there are only pros: it is healthy, has no side-effects, and has a high availability; there are many schools/classes for partner dance, and it is socially accepted to dance even intimately with strangers (even when in a monogamous relationship), and we do it usually with lots of different people (changing partners).
        - among dance styles, contact improvisation is one of the most ("the most"?) intimate form there is, and thus nourishes us also the most, substituting for any need for ingesting any molecule, or bringing our body in any potentially harmful dysbalance through intervening with its internal state.
    - of course a more philosophical question, to be 100% sober (all natural), or whether we can utilize items, and go beyond nature
* center of gravity/grounding (heavy, low, abdomen; being the base/underdancer) VS center of levitian/floating (light, high, chest; being the flyer/overdancer)
* new section: "oldschool CI" - impact, jump, acrobatic
* watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeSDsmIeHA
* read https://compendium.copim.ac.uk/practices/60
* still not sure: gravitons? which particle makes gravity? a field? physics not yet sure...
* prolog: "everything that can be learned (by yourself) is not worth being taught (by someone else)" ("alles was gelernt werden kann, ist nicht wert gelehrt zu werden")
    * intention of this book is to only teach what needs to be taught, everything else you can teach yourself ;)
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* beginners want to just enjoy, not willing to invest the necessary work ("too technical" they say; destroyed all their joy and fun). these people won't get far anywhere, not in CI nor in life in general. yes, fun/pleasure is important, but that itself won't get us anywhere. it's like learning to drive a car: first it might be fun to play as children in the car of our parents while it's turned off, but we don't actually getting somewhere. later we take driving lessons, very technical, hyper focused, tensed... not fun. once we mastered the steering wheel, padels, mirrors and rules in traffic, we can start to play and enjoy again, doing risky tricks/moves, have a talk and listen to music. BUT: there is no shortcut, we need to go through the intermediate state of hard work to finally reach the other end where there is joy again, built upon a firm foundation of repetition, dedication and commitment.
* terms/glossary: under-dancer, over-dancer
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* small dance (usually still, just listening inside); making it "small dance plus" by using that information as raw material/source and amplify it making it bigger/visible movements
* own section trios+
* contact, touch, negative space
* ad movement qualities: add speed, also pausing
* ad anatomy: muscle fibers (big/medium/small ones, innervening)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception
* don't seek perfection, but learn how to deal with unexpected outcomes (=mistakes) and use them to make it perfect (by improvising, and working with what is; "recovery strategies")
* ad: what is it? not a dance, because with dance, both partners sync to the music, and thus are in sync with each other. strong connection to the music. CI is originally without music, and if there is music, it is veeery much in the background. we let the people be the navigator and the driver. a free form expression, without the restrictions/limitations/manipulation of the music's atmosphere... it's also not sports or acrobatics, it is more of a "relational mindfulness practice in movement".
* EXERCISE: from knee sitting, other partner is standing on the side, pelvis&shoulders connect; from knee sitting into little animal, other partner goes with (sharing weight, yet sliding point of contact); and then A) fingers pointing away (easier) or B) towards the partner (more difficult). roll over partner, maybe with a small kick, make sure center-on-center (balanced; have a pause, break, verify you are stable, thus having all the options available again). go down on same or other side. stay in contact! don't lose umpf quality! for the base: you move, lower, support, push where needed.
* EXERCISE: bodysurf: start sitting back2back; legs bent (can push). one partner reaches stretched arms up and to one side, going onto his belly. other partner goes over, from other side, with his back on the lying partner (stay on the back, no spiral, otherwise no continuation easily possible; in this exercise). important: base is chicken-wing hooking the upper partner to ensure the centers are connected; also helps with the flyer, when he "drops", to use this as leverage to get up, ending into seated position again.
* EXERCISE: sit side2side, both spread legs; one partner rolls over between other's legs, reaching arm between first; then is upside down (weird/funny position, butt towards other's chest). stay very close to center (don't put weight on legs, painful); stay slow & controlled. sitting partner helps rolling partner with arms to roll over. also possible with 3 people (2 people back2back and 1 "roller")
* metaphor: it's like building a house; we sometimes fancy those amazing windows, that roof, that ceiling, the decoration, painting and facade... it looks great (from the outside). but we have not yet invested enough to build a proper basement, a foundation where the building can rest on. it turns out to be unstable, and almost collapse... the same with any skill, dance, or CI specifically. beginners are eager, and it's good wanting to learn, but be honest, be patient, and invest where it is most needed (and not just looks or feels good; feeding the ego, the inner child). without grounding (are any other basic principle), the lifts and more fancy techniques will have no substance. it will be not elegant, effortful, maybe even risky. you might do movements which resemble CI from the outside, but actually has nothing to do with it, as the principle/the essence is not adhered. to ground, to share weight, to have a connection, to be soft, agile, listening/syncing... a lifetime of practice. techniques are quick to learn, but have no substance.
* 1hr of class (=receiving new input) needs to be in proportion of about 3 hours of individual practice (repetition; focused/attentive/high-quality exercise). to research, "lab". doing the old, not adding something new again. or in the metaphor: once the building is built, and you want to add another floor/a tower, you have to improve the foundation first, otherwise: collapse (confusion, mixing up, messing up, mistakes, unclarity).
* a pause, stillness, silence... in a conversation, we often feel awkward. how comes? in dance, the same. a reset, emptiness, from where anything is possible again. like mindfulness and the clarity of the glass of water; so too the mind, and the body; let it sink.
* ad jargon, animals: dead fish (arm), not collapsed
* social aspect:
    * hygiene: good smells, fresh shirts; showered, but not intense scents!
    * during jam: we approach each other, ask for a dance (verbally or non-verbally); might helps if before have a bit of eye contact; feel free to say yes or no, both is welcome; stop the dance if you feel like so, there are no obligations.
    * start slowly with a new/unknown partner; very basic, check principles; slowly start with more techniques and see where your partner is, how far you can go with him; go through a mental checklist, building it up, and sketch a picture of his skills, where he is, and don't push/force too much what's not possible.
* sometimes develop a "fuck it" attitude. Seriously, develop an attitude of caring less, considering we all started to dance to feel pleasure, and not struggle and stress ourselves out to be good. It will help you to relax, to soften, and thus things will work actually even better. Just enjoy the dance.
* the art of giving feedback:
    * in our community, we give honest feedback, talk things through
    * always check where it comes from: want to genuinely help to get better? or push down, express your frustration?
    * positive/constructive feedback (nice, i liked it, well done, great progress) is always welcome; negative feedback (improvements) ask for permission, check whether other is open to receive it
    * formulate questions instead of commands: "how about...", "can we try..."
    * own experience can be the best teacher; switch roles, and try to demonstrate yourself (show how good you actually do it yourself, hehe)
    * have/show understanding/compassion; be kind and soft; be supportive, be patient, encouraging ("you can do that")
        * suggest taking smaller steps (literally), slow down, dissect; somehow take away complexity
    * don't criticize him, don't tell what they are doing wrong
        * don't let your own inner critic also affect your partner
        * when in doubt: say nothing (reden ist silber, schweigen ist gold)
        * ego, wanting to show its superiority?! that's a sign of weakness, those who are unable to give to those in need; scarcity vs abundance mentality; there's enough love for all of us, it doesn't divide, it multiplies
    * maybe use qualities, such as: tense, slow, tender, fast-paced, ... more neutral terms, yet subjective (own experience)
    * when there are conflicting opinions, curiously explore and research both possibilities; ultimately ask the teacher, as he should know a bit better usually ;)
    * we are all here to practice, we are all beginners and want to learn, and we still do mistakes, so do you; some of us are more soft-skinned/insecure, you'll destroy them; your self-harshness can stay inside, don't do to others
* communicate your boundaries, and in extreme cases, talk to the organizers (teachers/hosts) for support
* diff dance vs mindful partner movement: dance primary focus on music, secondary on partner. if both sync with music, they are in sync with each other. CI for example primary focus on the moment, the interaction, and music even not existing sometimes. also for free expression
* "find a partner" - something which can pose a challenge for some, sometimes; something in "regular" dance classes is much easier: "one to the left" ;)
* tip for practitioners: set reminder every X months to redefine all terms (what is CI for me; qualities; principles; values; ... they regularly change)
* rolls EXERCISE: alone, animal, standing
    * 1) aikido roll; in lanes on the ground
    * 2) on little animal (continuous, like did with yvette): in trios, guardian angel, saying "over" or "under"
    * 3) standing: more difficult&dangerous, only for advanced
* egalitarian: sooo nice + special about CI (and only very few dances out there; not only men/leader and women/follower let go, and not where it being switched, but no roles assigned at all)
    * as a strong (heavy) men, "finally i can feel like a woman, surrender to him, being taken care of, let go"
    * feel free to manipulate/lead, it's enjoyable as a receiver; that clarity feels great
    * the difference in experience/psycho-dynamics between MMF and MFF for example
* achieve symmetry: e.g. with spirals, standing, with foot starting, one side is easier, try to be good with both
    * although arguments for strengthening our strengths, and accept and use the asymetry
* don't try to find too eagerly possibilities to lift! let it happen, and if it doesn't, don't try to use it, because the moment will be immediately be gone (with lots of force, we can, yet not smart to do so; also breaks the flow/continuity)
* feldenkrais; impossible - possible - easy - elegant
* ad physics: a vector is { direction + magnitude } (that magnitude can be force, or anything else)
* ad anatomy: foot/feet/feets, one feet
* head up or down?
    * down, to surrender during floor work; to melt, to "nest"; breathe out while doing so to increase relaxation, yield/ground, soften, flow/adapt
    * up (in direction of trajectory/movement + eyes), direct, focus, engage, lift, fly, light/feather, upwards
* how to dance with a beginner as an advanced?
    * don't tell, but inspire; be a role-model and lead by example
    * convey the basics through the dance (grounding, push them gently, making it clear; sharing weight by leaning gently, gradually; rolling point of contact and slight force into pathway continuation)
    * be patient, go slow; don't get frustrated (you too started once, how would you have been liked to be treated; or when you join another dance class in a different style/school?!)
    * if nothing works: talk, use words; even more needed: take a break, create adhoc-examples; always compliment them of improvements (nicely done, great, good)
    * if yet nothing works; enjoy what is (and focus less on what there isn't)
* how to dance with an advanced as a beginner?
    * TODO
* how to dance the unwanted dance?
    * if your partner goes way too fast, is insensitive, seems to have inappropriate intentions, smells bad, ... TODO
* how to start a dance... yes, definitely eye contact can help sometimes if not clear (some people maybe don't see you, or are too shy to accept the invitation of dancing in negative space); look in eyes, smile, approach, mirror. now totally clear
* ad anatomy: "box" = torso basically; "ships" = shoulder and hips (connected, moveable in all 3 dimensions/planes)
* full body movement: arms + hands, head + eyes; with them engaged, everything gets much easier and moves better (try the opposite, go ahead)
* kinesthetic resonance... TODO: some research about it; sense the other ('s center), peripheric vision; empathy/mirror neurons, ... e.g. contagious yawning; one leans back, the other too (sympathy)
* to mirror the partner (movement, "energy", quality), to do otherwise feels like betrayal; the disconnect
* research mode: feels less enjoyable, more bumpy, experimental (who doesn't fall/fail, does something wrong; no growth, just staying in comfort zone, being cool, showing-off)
    * also less dancing with the partner, less focused on the dance itself, but more on the research topic
    * ego disclaimer useful: tell your partner that it will be worse that what usually capable of
* not only guidelines/recommendations for circle sharing, but also when 1on1 sharing. empathy, listen. talk about yourself, your own experience. never diagnose the other (you are too much of something), even if well intended and you think you are right (and the other one wrong). if wanna correct the other, ask for permission first (healthy feedback culture).
* yi moves -> qi moves -> body; touch it (with intention), there will be attention, there's the you (the self)
    * the touch increases awareness to that specific body part; use it in an exercise: touch your own bodypart (e.g. pelvis) and move along while touching
* sense the center of your partner. why?
    * to connect yours with theirs. to use this connection for lifts. to put your center onto theirs. to only give weight into that center into the ground (otherwise push the partner off-balance). the only way to safely share weight.
* have a moveable pelvis
    * other dance styles do it to look sexy; CI does it to "be" sexy ;) hehe
    * no, seriously: purely functional reason, to lift (especially hip lift), to connect
    * to sense, to connect, to lift
    * no, seriously seriously: CI can be seen as a highly sensual/sexual practice (although often people try to keep that out as much as possible); we humans are sexual beings, and by forcing it into the shadows, it might overpower us unconsciously, and there it may become dangerous; instead, acknowledge it, play with it, yet don't act upon it, stay in control; the plevis must be free, so our sexual energy must be allowed to flow freely; the pelvis, where our sexuality resides (2nd chakra according to tantra; like tantric exercises pelvis release)
    * if sexuality is blocked, CI doesn't work either (yet alone the obvious reason of no physical proximity, touch, intimacy possible; yet no sexuality/sensuality needed)
* discomfort in proxmity; for women: breasts, rolling over the front top; for men: penis, roling over front lower; same-sex partner usually more comfortable with
* rules when sharing in the circle. content. duration. why you share, benefit for others. speak slowly, connect to others, look. dont overshare, frequency.
* always have multiple shirts, sweaty. maybe small tshirt. be washed, smell nice, but no intense scents/perfumes.
* how to give feedback to your partner/s during exercise/dance.
* as a newbie, always good to let your partner know. ps: you are not too much, to the contrary, give more weight.
* choice of partner: male/female balance. old/young. much diversity helps you to grow. and allow yourself your favorites, depending on your capacity to work vs just enjoy. observe your patterns in choices, comfort zone, maybe extend it. also whether you go for it, or let yourself be chosen. do/try the opposite.
* for hiplift, the clock is needed. pelvis flexibility. e.g. not only scooping, but lowering one side as a ramp. first sense, seek, connect centers (dont jump). much can be cheated (chicken leg/wing), base can compensate.
* technique vs strength. see martial arts wisdom...
* !!! ad anatomy: stomach != belly!
* ad anatomy: pelvic/shoulder girdle
* build up: start - middle/core - end
    * start { talk, share, sense, aware, walk, trust }
    * middle { exercise, layered, research }
    * end { free play, wind down, slow, recover, conclusion }
    * ad middle part: single exercise build up:
        * demonstrate: pick/ask for volunteer, me on him (describe/diagnose/comment), then him on me, note where's my emphasize
        * open mic: for questions; confirm with "all clear?" -let's go (music ON)
        * execute and guide: walk around, give feedback, intermediate stop if necessary for group feedback; guide through giving cues, layers/sequences; switch partners
        * share: with partner, then with whole group
* difference: suggesting VS manipulating
    * suggesting: maintain agency of the partner, still can say yes/no
        * can be still a very strong push (useful for extra-ordinary moves/techniques, requiring the base of my partner)
    * manipulating: i force myself on him, grabbing his hand, wrap around/cover fully, no other choice
        * not bad per se, but preferably only with people you know well; some get triggered by it; can be a refreshing spice and open up totally new possibilities; can be very enjoyable too
* "the longer i do it, the slower i go, the fewer trickery i need, as i find {pleasure and joy? fulfillment and satisfaction! meaning and purpose} in the subtleties revealed in depth ('death'?)"
    * the more advanced/experienced i get, the slower i become, more depth in simplicity; no shiny tricks (that's for the intermediate ones); less lifts, more listening
    * when there is trust, we can go high; feeling safe, by going slow, being fully present
    * once we trust, we can go higher and faster
    * PS: acrobats often/usually/always (?) go (very) fast, and lots of tricks very quick, that's potentially very dangerous and they need to learn to slow the fuck down, to surrender in the slowness, to also explore the depth, to go deeper and find sensations in the subtleties, and be less easily attracted/entertained by the superficial trickery
* how to warm up yourself?
    * first of all: do it, don't wait for the teacher-parent to instruct you, to tell you what to do; you are supposed to be a grown up, so start take care of yourself (more important that you do it, instead of what you are doing)
    * easy way: just do what the teacher usually instructs at the beginning of the class -better: understand why he is doing it, and only do it if its applicable
    * lying down, as most dancers would do? maybe for some deep internal investigation, for increased body awareness (mindfulness practice), yes, maybe; for CI? not sure...
    * more inwards: mental awareness, stillness, parasympathicus (psychological body) VS active, physical awareness, sympathicus (physical body)
    * better: use CI to wake up CI relevant body parts! :) we mostly stand, so stand during your warm up; spiral; lifts, rolls, ... do everything you would usually do, just a bit slower/calmer/easier... turned down more. get yourself a partner and just dance, the best!
* the improvised nature of CI:
    * there is no usually not enough time to do something intentionally, e.g. when spotting something (e.g. a possibility for some nice technique), because usually that moment disappears instantly
    * yes, we sometimes can plan it, push it, even force it, a deliberate thing to do; but usually it's just working with what is
* when focusing on a specific research topic, let go of the idea of being good; dare to fuck it up, it's research, not performance;
    * "if you don't fall, you're doing it wrong", because you are playing in the comfort zone, where you can show off, pretend to be good, flawless, perfect; but it won't lead to growth, you will get stuck
    * allow yourself to fail, to fall; let go of your own expectation what you usually can do (yes, you are good enough; so now that you have that validation, can you please move on and research?!), and play/work with what is
    * stop trying to impress/please your partner
* observe your own tendencies: slow/fast, safe/risky, male/female, low/high, ... try to expand and explore both ends of the continuum for each dimension, to have (more) choice and grow
* read people's moving style: says something about/it's based on their past life experiences, their background (dance, acrobatic, ... + how to spot those), personality in general (trust/fear, confidence, self-esteem, easygoing, dare to risk/safe-unsafe risky/courageous, ok to fail/explore/research or play it safe, intimate/distant...), mood today (energy level, emotional state), obviously CI experience/skill
* three stages: beginner's (simple) joy, intermediate's hard work, expert's (sophisticated) joy
    * the reward comes later after the (hard) work
    * fun/pleasure is part of it, it is important to maintain dedication, to not lose motivation, as work alone is not really sustainable (yes, it requires discipline!)
    * but it alone will not get you very far; "up there" is much more fun than "down there"
* to find a (potential) dance partner (or join a duo?): make yourself noticeable by dancing in their negative space, like an accordion going in and out, don't stick too close all the time, give space
* 5 senses plus: balance (vestibular sense), body position (proprioception), movement (kinesthesia); and: pain (nociception), temperature (thermoception); ... many more
* be present with your partner, like in the army, got each other's backs; we re-lie on each other, save him when needed, be a team, together (don't break your partner, you won't get another one). the satisfying feeling when you were there when he needed you, almost fell; the quick response, surprising yourself; the feeling of being needed, being of use.
* have an active research mindset; when exploring a topic/exercise (labbing?), put some active effort in it, think and analyze (constructively; be in your head, as much as possible, but in a good/serving way); BUT: don't let it block you, but guide you. "thinking, a good slave, but a bad master".
    * research mode: staying aware with the exercise AND with the dance/with your partner, can be difficult. OPTIONAL: if you dance in a trio, with the third being the rover (satellite), pay attention to 1) the partner/dance 2) the exercise/research-topic 3) the rover (super difficult shared attention skill)
* EXERCISE: start back2back, going down and up via squad; next: back2back walk in one direction, one partner goes down, other free falls while extending arms; from little animal, one person to the side, other on top, and stand up again (watch out that first upper body upright, and then go upwards), pay attention to not lose the connection (back, lower and upper, and even head)
* list of hints on how to identify a beginner/advanced:
    * clothing: beginners show often lots of skin, dressed sexy; advanced wear their (non-sexy) pyjamas, long sleeves/pants; it's not tango, we don't want to impress, we are who we are, authentical us, not more not less. also sliding on the ground is not possible with direct skin contact, thus skin is covered.
    * touch: beginners use a lot the fingers and hands with a very very soft "butterfly touch" (usually hippie people from the ecstatic dance community); advanced use more the torso and have a weighted touch, when using (fore)arms even those are properly weighted
        * yet, it is not binary/extreme: advanced also can have "cat feet" and have versatile hands. butterfly touch is ok, but not if it is the only tool in your toolbox, and it should be definitely not the default.
    * steps: beginners make lots of little elephants, quick, sharp, loud steps, indicating uncontrolled and potentially dangerous moves; advanced can step like feathers (butterfly steps and elephant arms; not other way round)
* as a good exercise partner (the passive part), you are very actively engaged about what is being done; you observe your partner where he is, what he needs, see his deficiencies and encourage his possibilities (potential), you anticipate a useful scenario where he can grow (proximal zone of development), when there was the slightest improvement compliment saying something simple as "nice"; serve him, be a little teacher
* how to start a dance?
    * same for joining a single or an existing duo...
    * first dance in proximity, dance negative space.
        * usually no eye contact, but sometimes it helps, and then definitely smile, it makes you more likeable/trustworthy.
        * NEVER approach people from the back (they can't see you) and especially NEVER touch right away; no possibility for consent there
    * WAIT - so they are aware of your presence and intention.
    * be attentative to response of you; are they moving towards or away from you?
    * if towards: do some "grasing", backs of arms. usually start back2back.
    * if away: also retreat, respect the people's no, and preferably not take it personally (it might be, but you don't know)
        * recover, shake it off, and try again
        * if you really dare, you can ask the people afterwards about what happened, and how they interpreted it; ask for feedback, what you could have done differently (different approaching, take a shower, change behavior); use it to improve, not to push yourself down.
* how to assess someone's level of skill? give weight or not, pathway continuation or breaking (front of body), jumping, elephants, etc. breath, stiffness/relaxation/muscle tone.
* vocabulary:
    * pouring: slowly/mindfully transferring weight into another physical object (partner/floor). if it would be fast, we would "throw" our weight.
    * yielding: relaxation of muscle tension, usually into gravitation pull (but also other external forces, e.g. push of another person), usually towards the ground (gravitational direction).
    * collapsing: complete, sudden relaxation of muscles, losing structure, without control (no reversability; usually not desired but sometimes can be used as a spice); similar with pouring VS throwing, is yielding VS collapsing
    * center VS core: center=point of gravitational center, below naval (spiritual systems refer also "energetic center"), for women slightly lower (pelvis-shoulder sex difference); core-everything which is connected to the spin, from pubic bone to lower ribs, abs and back, sides/obliques.
* grounding exercise: with partner, he says ground/tense/yield (don't collapse!) or "claw" (one hand super tensed), and "free"
* grounded: person's center connected to earth's center; all qualities together (yield, push/pull, reach)
* address the situation of dancing with partners of different levels (with perspective of you being in different levels), all the possible combinations, and how to still get the most out of it ("dance with the partner, not with the skill")
* ad anatomy: check that the word "tonality" is explained (=muscle tension)
* ad round-robin: usually 2,3,4 couples in center, in&out; or different format: half goes in (find partner, assign A/B), other half witnesses with full presence (learning passively)
* stand up, walk, find a place in room. small dance (involuntary micromovements to keep balanced/stand upright), close eyes. breathe. unlock knees. ground... move head left/right, open eyes, checkout others, who is grounded, who not. keep looking outwards into space (dont drawn inwards, like ecstatic dance, stay with the big body). now double the grounding, shift weight (pendulum, not metronom). caress the ground with pointed toes, move hand, arms, ribcage. octopus quality. breathe. smile and look at others. start walking. in negative space move. also look behind yourself with your back.
* 3x3x3: orbit around another center. no eye contact, not front2front. maybe trio. no contact first. slow down much. find backs, share weight, breathe out... 5,4,3,2,1... bye. shake it off. walk around. after 3rd: find a comfortable position for both. let them talk a bit, drink. back to big circle. sharing. next!
* grounding is NOT heavy! do the shiatsu "find your center". take from taiji. do the competition pushing each other over, circle, enter whoever wants.
* consent exercises: coming closer, waving 12345, different ways approaching. push, partner says "stop", we say thank you.
* exercise: how to enter and leave a duette. a few rovers. game: in trio, try that other 2 cant dance with each other.
* bring more personal stories, make it relatable. what happened in toms classes, etc.
* GROUNDING is not contracting muscles; making you stiff; it may feel like stable/robust (grounded), but it's not. easily checked by testing you, by a partner; are you still agile, flexible, can you move? can you breathe freely? groundedness means still being relaxed and soft, surrender, let gravity pull heavy on your body into the floor; it's relaxation (opening), not contraction (closing). yet, easily mixed up, as the sensation might be similar at first. also: with contraction there is some degree of success possible (when the partner pouring his weight onto you), but it has its limitations, it is effortfull, and takes away flexibility/adaptibility, thus ultimate is dangerous.

  !!! workshop notes flying incorporate
  ! gravity - steve paxton book
* write more about anatomy, vestibular/inner ear
* write more about gravity in physics (counter intuitive reality; unknown quantum realm, gravitrons?)
* combine this: how movement and gravitational pull relates
* nancy stark, underscore
* add more exercises
* term "score" (exercise? theme?); underscore
* dresscode: no jewelery (rings, ear rings, bracelets) as dangerous, no belt, not too much naked skin (sweaty, slippery, and for some people too sexy/uncomfortable; some decency, CI is a non-sensual practice)
* no "parking" or socializing on the dancefloor, move to the sides
* guide how to dis/engage a dance: mirror the person, bit eye contact, finger/hand touch, back2back; disengage namaste/hug, use water drinking as excuse, say thank you and roll away
* attitudes: playful, curiosity, care, responsibility
* what makes CI different: all levels (not just standing), it's 3D; and also 1/2/many people dancing with each other; it's goal is not to be aesthetical pleasing (as with most dance forms)
* basic body skills: relaxation (not stiff), listening (following), gentle/softness, flexibility/mobility, in joints, balance, general body awareness.
* under/overdancer is superset of base/flyer
* movement quality: expand/fold alias flexion/extension (going down fold, going up expand).
* saying stop/no, consent, safety during dance. tom's workshop. orange/red boundary. not endura. last ressort: say out loud.
* uncommon spices: manipulation of the head, counter-balancing
* the advantage of going slow. more input/details, safer. if can do slow, also fast (but not other way round).
* nesting a la raul. fill the space. cuddle in; esp. floorwork.
* also raul: giving air, finding bridges. basically give away weight while partner aligns.
* move eyes, moves head, moves spine, moves everything else.
* breathe!!!! relax, be moveable again. also to co-regulate partner/others in the room.
* dresscode: kneepads. which ones, what to watch out for. also for pants, not to loose because getting stuck.
* ad jam, bring multiple shirts, because sweaty. in general: hygiene (body, mouth, clothes, nails), as close up.
* processus spinosus - part of spine bulging out (protrusion), when you do a roll wrong
* ad physics: pressure measured in newton (i think 10N = 1kg?)
* idea: small chapter about basic injuries (after quick intro into tissue and stuff), like dislocation, hematome; what it is, how it might happen, and how to treat it (movement/stillness, taping, warmth/cold, massage, ...)
* ad movement: kinesphere; picture is similar to Da Vinci's "vitruvian man" but more complex
* harvest video, and keep track that done so in list: https://youtu.be/9FeSDsmIeHA?si=h3kcbSBgbbz2mhbM
