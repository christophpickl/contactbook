* insights from my workshop
  * based on the questions from beginners
    * without grounding there is nothing, no foundation, nothing to build upon
    * breathing, breathing, breathing -a constant reminder, useful
    * general: what is CI (compared to others)? what is its history?
    * why not grab the hands? (it feels more safe)
    * why do we depersonalize the dance partner? isn't it devaluing?
    * ad tantric distance: does it mean the partner is constantly in our bed?!
    * WHY? do we do this exercise, how is it relevant during the dance?
    * soft skills: social (start/end/join a dance), boundary/consent is important!
  * based on what i observed them having difficulties
    * instead of floating, making themselves light, people tend to be a heavy iron ball
    * there is an eagerness (adrenalin, excitement) which can be dangerous; or simply destroying the beauty of an "it's just happening" experience (jumping instead of pouring weight)
    * counter-acting your inner doubts, blocking your success: use positive affirmation, it is easy, you are light (some of us feel too heavy, a burden...)
  * how i can expand in the "teaching" chapter. a good teacher ...
    * will allow you to explore/research by yourself; time wise, but also open that you do it slightly differently; there is no right/wrong but differences in goals/context/approaches
    * will invest enough time for the psychological/personal, the bonding of the group into a community to create a safe space (sharings, etc)
    * acknowledges his limits in practical ability and knowledge; he will admit and own it with confidence; being realistic, down to earth, humble
* a full 2hrs class (exercises):
  * solo sit, shift weight from butt-cheek to other; hand on ground, scissor legs, feet ALWAYS stay on the ground; when turning right, left leg goes first (also extend with left arm; reach long)
  * ... MAXIMUM RELAXATION/SOFTNESS ...
  * do the same lying down, relax the head
  * do full turns now; basically a shrimp+starfish movement
  * do full turns + in little animal up; do it in lanes, both sides (L/R; facing head opposite directions)
  * find partner...
  * first on same spot in room (pre-exercise): little animal positions; inner leg first over on belly, same side hand (as leg over) moves, spiral on the back legs first onto the partner
  * in lanes: both roll (like done before), one goes in little animal, other follow and over (as before)
  * pre-exercise: do the 90 degrees starfish exercise/turn solo on the spot (with teacher-partner)
  * traditional bodysurf
    * WATCH OUT to always cross/be perpendicular, and not parallel (otherwise too much weight on the partner; also risk to put weight on knees/head); either arms or legs, but never both go over at the same time 
  * "pick-up: partner exercise:
    * base is rolling "against" (into/towards) the partner with belly or back; then "releases", so flyer is "falling"/"drops" into partner
    * surfer/flyer relaxes head back, articulates spine, let legs softly follow by themselves
    * don't jump! avoid quick, sharp moves as they are potentially dangerous/risky
  * free dance (explore, integrate); sharing
  * partner A rolling towards B, B putting knee under the "belt area" (belly/lower back); timing is relevant; A rolling over
    * IMPORTANT: keep centers connected! (use chicken legs)
    * then other partner offers "surface below"
    * stay SLOW&CONTROLLED, RELAXED&SOFT
  * continuation: "pick up" technique again, and immediately move "support under" (combining both skills)
    * possibly B helps a bit by using his hand to pull A's center a bit
  * CLASSICAL HIP LIFT:
    * begin with hand sliding diagonally over front of partner
      * it's like "picking up" technique on the floor: taking initiative for a lift as the base, not waiting for the flyer to initiate)
    * get sure to offer enough "side ramps", for going on/off
  * AD LIFTS: get sure when going down, one has to change direction (usually/easier for the base)
