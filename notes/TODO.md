TO*DO list
====================================================================================================

* roter faden; book's ultimate goal:
  * watch out that it doesn't get too big (split afterward; maybe beginner VS experienced); less is more (30-100 pages)
  * for beginners (not profi/experienced); total noobs
* start to sketch first few drawings
* !!! incorporate feedback v1; review the whole book again
* move "mottos" into "safety" chapter
* all "fancy words" as glossary items?

IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* add waaaay more sketches with explanatory symbols (little people, roughly drawn, with arrows indicating directions, etc.)
* => generally comment for book: be balanced in judgments, shine light to cons AND PROs! e.g. when talking about flow/fun/feel/...
  * at the end, explicitly then state my personal opinion (like kurzgesagt does)
* fun chapter about "CI archetypes" (list pros and cons of each of them)
  * e.g. the ecstatic dance hippie (overly wobbly, smells funny and fancy clothes), the acrobat (fast, technical, dangerous), the dancer (very accentuated, more decoration than substance), the sexy hunter (male or female; little clothes, overly sensual), the rock (insensitive muscle guy lifting everyone, especially small women)
* add more drawings: of vectors (for push/pull/yield... 2 objects)
* start to draw drawings (movement, explanations; not only illustrations)
* @tom: can you give me all your CI videos? :)
* add way more exercises to be done by the reader
* latex templates: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/book
* ask that blonde lady, which interviewed me once; whether i can get her notes please (from all she interviewed).
* rework glossary: scan whole document for terms; rework existing ones (descriptions; capital casing??)
