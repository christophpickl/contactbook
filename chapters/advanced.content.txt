* don't seek perfection, but learn how to deal with unexpected outcomes (=mistakes) and use them to make it perfect (by improvising, and working with what is; "recovery strategies")
* tip for practitioners: set reminder every X months to redefine all terms (what is CI for me; qualities; principles; values; ... they regularly change)
* achieve symmetry: e.g. with spirals, standing, with foot starting, one side is easier, try to be good with both
    * although arguments for strengthening our strengths, and accept and use the asymmetry
* "the longer i do it, the slower i go, the fewer trickery i need, as i find {pleasure and joy? fulfillment and satisfaction! meaning and purpose} in the subtleties revealed in depth ('death'?)"
    * the more advanced/experienced i get, the slower i become, more depth in simplicity; no shiny tricks (that's for the intermediate ones); less lifts, more listening
    * when there is trust, we can go high; feeling safe, by going slow, being fully present
    * once we trust, we can go higher and faster
    * PS: acrobats often/usually/always (?) go (very) fast, and lots of tricks very quick, that's potentially very dangerous and they need to learn to slow the fuck down, to surrender in the slowness, to also explore the depth, to go deeper and find sensations in the subtleties, and be less easily attracted/entertained by the superficial trickery
* three stages: beginner's (simple) joy, intermediate's hard work, expert's (sophisticated) joy
    * the reward comes later after the (hard) work
    * fun/pleasure is part of it, it is important to maintain dedication, to not lose motivation, as work alone is not really sustainable (yes, it requires discipline!)
    * but it alone will not get you very far; "up there" is much more fun than "down there"
* list of hints on how to identify a beginner/advanced:
    * clothing: beginners show often lots of skin, dressed sexy; advanced wear their (non-sexy) pyjamas, long sleeves/pants; it's not tango, we don't want to impress, we are who we are, authentical us, not more not less. also sliding on the ground is not possible with direct skin contact, thus skin is covered.
    * touch: beginners use a lot the fingers and hands with a very very soft "butterfly touch" (usually hippie people from the ecstatic dance community); advanced use more the torso and have a weighted touch, when using (fore)arms even those are properly weighted
        * yet, it is not binary/extreme: advanced also can have "cat feet" and have versatile hands. butterfly touch is ok, but not if it is the only tool in your toolbox, and it should be definitely not the default.
    * steps: beginners make lots of little elephants, quick, sharp, loud steps, indicating uncontrolled and potentially dangerous moves; advanced can step like feathers (butterfly steps and elephant arms; not other way round)
* how to assess someone's level of skill? give weight or not, pathway continuation or breaking (front of body), jumping, elephants, etc. breath, stiffness/relaxation/muscle tone.
* uncommon spices: manipulation of the head, counter-balancing
* beginners and advanced are safe, just the intermediates are dangerous
  * BEGINNERS: they know that they don't know (and can't) yet, they go slow, are humble
  * ADVANCED: they know their limitations (like beginners, are humble too), and when to break the rule safely
  * INTERMEDIATE: overly confident, risky behavior, showing off; insecure-arrogance; dunning-kruger effect
    * anti-dot: humbleness, open-mindedness; going slow! ask for feedback; be more precise; back to basics
* beginner's mistake: don't INVITE yourself on your partner
  * ability to say&hear a yes/no to/for an INVITATION for lifting
    * never force yourself on your partner (== invite yourself), but be slow, be perceptive, listen carefully, be with your partner
  * in the netherlands we make an appointment to meet, and not just knock at the door like a surprise-visit
    * thus, don't jump on your partner, heavy impact, unexpected, and potentially dangerous (and impolite)
  * the base decides a lift (usually); with already familiar partners, you may surprise them
* STRENGTH VS technique: one can compensate for the other
  * strength has limitations and gets weaker the older we get, technique (sensitivity, alignment/posture, etc.) has none (infinite possibility to grow, to get more sensitive)
  * "what I lack of technique, I compensate with strength. the one who hasn't strength, must only rely on technique."
    * ultimately it's better to have both available if possible ;)
    * technique vs strength. see martial arts wisdom... the less technique i have, the more i need to compensate with strength; preferrably i have both; technique never ends, always can increase (more sensitive), even when getting older; strength has a limit, and decreases with age; technique makes things more effortless (but mind needs to engage more, than body), relaxed, thus smooth/elegant
* the SMALL THINGS matter: eyes, fingers, hands
  * if the EYES go down, we are in a state of hyperfocus (not good); we need to be more relaxed, look into the space
    * have a blurry, relaxed, peripheral vision with your surrounding (also safety wise important); catch all, non-focused
    * stay connected to the "big body", don't go into a hyper-internal-focus-state (ecstatic dance)
  * contact people vs contact dancers: 1) are amateurs, reach only until the wrist 2) are professionals, reach beyond the FINGERS
  * new animal "DEAD FISH HANDS": we are not active, not engaged. same with pilates/yoga/ballet/dancers: if the fingers reach, the whole body will be more engaged (same with good taijiquan practitioners, which only very few are able to do)
* problem of "always doing the SAME", STUCK in the same movement patterns / how to learn new pathways?
  * very common, especially among professional dancers (they dance with beginners to get inspired, as those are still freed from the limitations of a specific system)
  * solutions:
    * ask a partner to PAUSE you, touch a body, and move from there.
      * or let him control your body (e.g. remote control your head); surrender, and let yourself be guided.
    * SURRENDER, let your partner inspire/manipulate you
    * go very FAST (but watch: risky), as "in chaos lies creation" (creativity); like 5 rhythms, shiva.
    * when you are stuck with a familiar PARTNER ("shared patterns"), go find a new partner
* always ADAPT the technique (timing/weight-giving/positioning/...) according to your partner's weight/size/strength/age/...
  * everything changes; stay open, listen, have different partners
* ADVANCED topics/aspects to emphasize: tonality, breaking the bubble
  * TONALITY (ad anatomy): muscle tone/tonus, amount of tension in muscles; should be in the middle, flexible like a bamboo/rubber plastic; relaxed yet not collapsed; active yet not stiff
    * EXERCISE (from gaga): imagine as if you would move through air/water/honey/concrete
  * "breaking the BUBBLE": reconnect to what is going on
    * the bubble being: eyes down, going inwards, not being present with the environment (big body/space)
* ways of LOOKING GOOD/impress/show-off (demonstrate):
  * collaboration/team work: if one fucks up, the other compensates (no passive/static posture)
  * cheating: use a lot of chicken wings/legs when off-balance
  * strength/use brute force: for compensating lack of technique
* TIP CORE STRENGTH: on how to work on your core strength for the superman position (reach, extend, being a rod/stick):
  * use a big inflatable ball (gymnastics), and balance on it in straightened position (belly, back, sideways)
* personal preference as images: i prefer dancing with scalpel, precise, elegant, fine, safe... not with hammers: rough, rigid, inaccurate, dangerous, ...
  * i like to dance with a jaguar, soft, gentile, agile, strong, quick if necessary, confident/humble/calm, playful, deadly
  * i don't like mosquitoes, just hyperactive, unstable, no core/essence, boring and annoying with their little "meeeee" sound
    * barking like a little dog but nothing behind it just showing-off, pretending out of insecurity
  * i also don't like dancing with hippos, fat, slow, heavy, immovable, stomping, insensitive tanks.
  * what does the personal like/dislike say about myself? my values/associations...
* difference beginner and master: master always knows the "why" (deeper understanding of the reason)
  * thus also can divert from the norm/rules (break them deliberately, and still it's not a mistake/error/fault; risk-free, responsible)
  * deliberate choice (circus bicycle clown like a beginner, because he decides to)
* if "the body always knows the truth" (and keeps the score ;) and "always trust (your) nature", how comes we have to work so hard to override our natural bodily impulses?
  * e.g. tensing up, holding breath, looking down, ...
  * is it just a maladaptive behavior? when fear and fall, tension is like a muscle shield.
  * or psychological-trauma-fuckup?! as children through shit, now acquired ineffective impulses/behaviors
  * thus, as babies we were in our "true" nature, and everything was indeed always reliable (seems like a romantic fairy tale to me)
* justifying doing "whatever" by saying it's "improvised", then what are we doing?
  * like shiatsu: if it's everything, it's nothing. to define, we need inner/outer, boundaries, to say what it's not, so we know what it is.
* be in HEAD and BODY: thinking focused on being present with physical sensations
  * being in the head; not only embody, but be conscious about it; to have deliberate choices to play with it
    * nothing is absolute (good/bad, just useful (or not) in specific circumstances; like a hammer/screwdriver)
  * "you can only not do it, if you can (deliberately) do it" (violence/fighting in martial arts)
  * CAVE/watch out: we have a tendency to justify our inability and laziness by saying:
    * "i use my intuition, i don't need to learn this or that"
    * "i'm in the flow, i don't need to make an effort"
    * "i am here to have fun and play, not to work or doing exercises as it brings me into my head and i don't enjoy it anymore"
    * first work needs to be done to gain the harvest (anyone who's promising you anything else is most likely after your money and/or your body); there are no shortcuts!
  * people want to be in the flow only, without doing the necessary hard work, but:
    * to even increase the flow capacity, we have to do the work; the play/fun gets even better with the work being done
    * when in flow, things already need to be available in autopilot, which requires hard/conscious work before, no way around it!
  * balance: 80/20, where there is frustration on bad days, there is the potential for growth
    * we need effortful work, play will not bring us through those times (wrong tool)
    * if you don't push through it but avoid, you will stay in the lower levels and not being able to see the beauty, the pleasure/fun/joy up high in the skies over the mountains
  * balance of yin/yang, think/feel, fun/work, flow/deliberate, ... have both available, to choose, no extremes, max 80/20, all relative, no absolutes; we need both (just tools)
  * "you are so much in your body for so long, overly emphasized by you and your environment, that you forgot how to use your head, something that makes you human, homo sapiens"
