ABOUT this (new) chapter
==================================================================
* not the observable itself, the physical; more the internal, intention, attention, attitude/mindset/mentality, approach, how we engage, visualization; the social, interpersonal and psychological

CONTENT
==================================================================
* intimacy is (more) about intention, not so much about observable, physical behavior
* it's good to be in your head! don't be mistaken; 1) but don't ruminate, but contemplate. don't think in circles, unproductive thoughts, but think in lines, constructive. 2) don't get distracted, thinking about groceries, but keep your thoughts focused on what's going on right now 3) even the inner critic is welcome, complaining that you are not doing the very first moment perfectly, although you have never done it before, and it is rather unrealistic that anyone on earth would be able to do so, but you of course have the expectation on yourself that you do! listen to that voice, acknowledge it, let it motivate to do it better, use it as a friend, rather try to silence it as an enemy; he means good, but is sometimes a bit over to top, calm him down, by compassion/kindness/empathy. (to resist is to persist)
* anticipation of your own, and especially partners trajectory (during an improvised, non-predictable way of moving). jedi knight skill, trained during walking (quickly) through crowds, not bumping, allowing the subconsciousness to do the calculations, mapping physical objects (people/bodies) as vectors in a 2D plane. psychologically grounding and thus physically being more grounded (breathe in, hold breath, going up, arms up, get tensed; vs: breathe out, deep breath, stay or even lower center of gravity, spiral away/on spot). during dancing (especially with a trio+), we do the same, whether unconsciously or in rare occasion also consciously. we try to predict based on the current momentum and pathway where our partner(s) will be, and try to be there for them, to support and guide. to enable what's not possible just by oneself, to create a feeling of doing it together, in connection. building trust, safety, predictability. holding each other. taking care, by paying/giving attention
* a pause, stillness, silence... in a conversation, we often feel awkward. how comes? in dance, the same. a reset, emptiness, from where anything is possible again. like mindfulness and the clarity of the glass of water; so too the mind, and the body; let it sink.
* sometimes develop a "fuck it" attitude. Seriously, develop an attitude of caring less, considering we all started to dance to feel pleasure, and not struggle and stress ourselves out to be good. It will help you to relax, to soften, and thus things will work actually even better. Just enjoy the dance.
* research mode: feels less enjoyable, more bumpy, experimental (who doesn't fall/fail, does something wrong; no growth, just staying in comfort zone, being cool, showing-off)
    * also less dancing with the partner, less focused on the dance itself, but more on the research topic
    * ego disclaimer useful: tell your partner that it will be worse that what usually capable of
* yi moves -> qi moves -> body; touch it (with intention), there will be attention, there's the you (the self)
    * the touch increases awareness to that specific body part; use it in an exercise: touch your own bodypart (e.g. pelvis) and move along while touching
* difference: suggesting VS manipulating
    * suggesting: maintain agency of the partner, still can say yes/no
        * can be still a very strong push (useful for extra-ordinary moves/techniques, requiring the base of my partner)
    * manipulating: i force myself on him, grabbing his hand, wrap around/cover fully, no other choice
        * not bad per se, but preferably only with people you know well; some get triggered by it; can be a refreshing spice and open up totally new possibilities; can be very enjoyable too
* when focusing on a specific research topic, let go of the idea of being good; dare to fuck it up, it's research, not performance;
    * "if you don't fall, you're doing it wrong", because you are playing in the comfort zone, where you can show off, pretend to be good, flawless, perfect; but it won't lead to growth, you will get stuck
    * allow yourself to fail, to fall; let go of your own expectation what you usually can do (yes, you are good enough; so now that you have that validation, can you please move on and research?!), and play/work with what is
    * stop trying to impress/please your partner
* observe your own tendencies: slow/fast, safe/risky, male/female, low/high, ... try to expand and explore both ends of the continuum for each dimension, to have (more) choice and grow
* have an active research mindset; when exploring a topic/exercise (labbing?), put some active effort in it, think and analyze (constructively; be in your head, as much as possible, but in a good/serving way); BUT: don't let it block you, but guide you. "thinking, a good slave, but a bad master".
    * research mode: staying aware with the exercise AND with the dance/with your partner, can be difficult. OPTIONAL: if you dance in a trio, with the third being the rover (satellite), pay attention to 1) the partner/dance 2) the exercise/research-topic 3) the rover (super difficult shared attention skill)
* attitudes: playful, curiosity, care, responsibility
* movement quality: expand/fold alias flexion/extension (going down fold, going up expand).
* the advantage of going slow. more input/details, safer. if can do slow, also fast (but not other way round).
* if you are too tensed, make "brrrr"-sound with lips to relax, keep the breath active
